Suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev died after a gunfight with police several days later, while Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, was captured and lies in a hospital prison. Three more suspects have been taken into custody in the marathon bombings, police said Wednesday, May 1, 2013. (AP Photo/The Lowell Sun \u0026 Robin Young, File)\nBOSTON - A suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings died from gunshot wounds and blunt trauma to his head and torso, his death certificate says.\nWorcester funeral home owner Peter Stefan has 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev\u0027s body and read details from his death certificate on Friday. The certificate cites Tsarnaev\u0027s \"gunshot wounds of torso and extremities,\" Stefan said.\nTsarnaev died last month after a gunfight with authorities a few days after the deadly marathon bombing. Police have said he ran out of ammunition before his younger brother dragged his body under a vehicle while fleeing the scene.\nTsarnaev\u0027s family was making arrangements for his funeral as investigators searched the woods near a college attended by his younger brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, on Friday.\nThe funeral parlour in Worcester is familiar with Muslim services and said it will handle arrangements for Tamerlan Tsarnaev, whose body was released by the state medical examiner Thursday night.\nThe body was taken initially to a North Attleborough funeral home, where it was greeted by about 20 protesters. Stefan, owner of Graham Putnam and Mahoney Funeral Parlors in Worcester, an hour\u0027s drive west of Boston, said everybody deserves a dignified burial service no matter the circumstances of his or her death and he is prepared for protests.\nTsarnaev died three days after the bombing in a furious getaway attempt in which authorities say he and his brother, ethnic Chechens from Russia who came to the United States about a decade ago, killed an MIT campus police officer and tossed homemade bombs and grenades at police. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, ran over his brother\u0027s body as he drove away from the scene to escape, authorities have said.\nMeanwhile, two U.S. officials said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told interrogators that he and his brother initially considered setting off their bombs on July Fourth.\nBoston police said they planned to review security procedures for the Independence Day Boston Pops concert and fireworks display, which draws a crowd of more than 500,000 annually and is broadcast to a national TV audience. Authorities plan to look at security procedures for large events held in other cities, notably the massive New Year\u0027s Eve celebration held each year in New York City\u0027s Times Square, Massachusetts state police spokesman David Procopio said.\nGov. Deval Patrick said everything possible will be done to assure a safe event.\n\"I think the most important thing is that we got them, and there\u0027s investigation continuing about where the other leads may lead,\" he said. \"I can tell you, having been thoroughly briefed, that the law enforcement at every level is pursuing everything.\"\nAs part of the bombing investigation, federal, state and local authorities were searching the woods near the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth campus, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was a student. Christina DiIorio-Sterling, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, could not say what investigators were looking for but said residents should know there is no threat to public safety.\nDzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was found hiding in a tarp-covered boat in a suburban Boston backyard, faces a charge of using a weapon of mass destruction to kill. Three of his college classmates were arrested Wednesday and accused of helping after the bombing to remove a laptop and backpack from his dormitory room before the FBI searched it.\nThe April 15 bombing, using pressure cookers packed with explosives, nails, ball bearings and metal shards, killed three people and injured more than 260 others near the marathon\u0027s finish line.\nThe brothers considered setting off their bombs on July Fourth but decided to carry out the attack sooner when they finished assembling the bombs, the surviving suspect told interrogators after he was arrested, according to two U.S. officials briefed on the investigation. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation.\nInvestigators believe some of the explosives used in the attack were assembled in Tamerlan Tsarnaev\u0027s home, though there may have been some assembly elsewhere, one of the officials said. It does not appear that the brothers ever had big, definitive plans, the official said.\nThe brothers\u0027 mother insists the allegations against them are lies.\nMeanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security ordered border agents to immediately begin verifying that every international student who arrives in the U.S. has a valid student visa, according to an internal memorandum obtained Friday by The Associated Press. The new procedure is the government\u0027s first security change directly related to the Boston bombings.\nThe order from a senior official at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, David J. Murphy, was circulated Thursday and came one day after President Barack Obama\u0027s administration acknowledged that one of the students accused of hiding evidence, Azamat Tazhayakov, of Kazakhstan, was allowed to return to the U.S. in January without a valid student visa.\nTazhayakov\u0027s lawyer has said he had nothing to do with the bombing and was shocked by it.\nA benefit concert featuring Aerosmith, James Taylor and Jimmy Buffett is scheduled for May 30 at the TD Garden in Boston. The proceeds will go to The One Fund, which has taken in more than $28 million for those injured and the families of those who were killed.\nThe fund\u0027s administrator, Kenneth Feinberg, said Friday he plans to hold meetings with victims next week and begin cutting checks by the end of June.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Steve LeBlanc in Boston and Pete Yost, Eileen Sullivan and Alicia A.

James will become the fifth player with at least four MVP awards, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan, Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain.\nNo one has ever swept every first-place vote in the NBA\u0027s MVP balloting.

It was absolutely no surprise that he won the award, and given the timetable for Miami\u0027s next game - the Heat don\u0027t open Eastern Conference semifinal play until Monday night against Brooklyn or Chicago - it had been widely assumed for several days that Sunday would be the day.\n\"I absolutely have not even thought about it,\u0027\u0027 James said earlier this week when asked if he considered the weight of winning the award four times in five years. \"I have not thought about it, until you just brought it up.

James scored 30 points, Ray Allen had another big game against his old team and the Miami Heat got their first playoff sweep in the Big Three era, advancing to the Eastern Conference semifinals with an 88-77 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks on Sunday.\n“It was our next big step as far as our growth,” James said. “It’s so hard to win on the road in the playoffs, in someone’s building — especially when someone is playing for their last life. It’s a big step for us.”\nAnd now the Heat have some much-needed time to rest. Dwyane Wade sat out Sunday’s game, only the second postseason game he’s missed in his career, because of his aching right knee. But with Miami not playing until next Saturday, at the earliest, he’ll have plenty of time to treat the three bone bruises that caused him to miss six games near the end of the regular season.\nMiami plays the winner of the Brooklyn-Chicago series. The Bulls lead that series 3-1, with Game 5 on Monday night in New York.\nRELATED: MELO CAN\u0027T SHOOT KNICKS PAST CELTICS\n“It’s big,” Wade said of the time off. “Obviously, we’re one of the oldest teams in the league, maybe the oldest team in terms of rotation players. Guys have some bumps and bruises coming out of this series, so it’s going to be great to get some rest. But also we have to take this time to continue to stay sharp, to continue to stay in shape as well.”\nJudging by the clinical way in which the Heat dissected the Bucks in this series, that isn’t likely to be a problem. The defending NBA champions won each game by double digits, getting contributions from their stars and subs alike. Allen finished with 16 points, the third time in the series he scored in double figures, and was 4 of 7 from 3-point range. Udonis Haslem added 13 points and five rebounds, and Mario Chalmers kicked in eight rebounds and six assists for Miami, which never trailed Sunday.\n“They had the whole package,” Bucks coach Jim Boylan said. “When you can afford to sit guy like Dwyane Wade and perform at the level they performed at, that’s a championship-caliber team.”\nMonta Ellis led the Bucks with 21 points, and Larry Sanders had 11 rebounds to go with seven points. But Milwaukee got almost nothing again from Brandon Jennings , who didn’t even play in the fourth quarter. Jennings, who had guaranteed the Bucks would win the series in six games, finished with three points on 1-of-7 shooting. After scoring 26 points in Game 1, Jennings had 27 total in the final three.\nJEFF HAYNES/REUTERS\nLeBron James dunks in Miami\u0027s Game 4 win.\n“Frustrated, a little down because I came into this season with so much confidence,” he said. “I thought we had a chance to steal a game in Game 1, Game 2. We let that slip away from us. Game 3, we came back home. Had a 10-point lead, lost that. I mean it’s frustration all around.”\nThe Heat had chances to sweep their first-round series in each of the last two seasons, taking 3-0 leads on Philadelphia (2011) and New York (2012). But they couldn’t close it out, losing Game 4 each year.\n1\n","source":"google_52778141777464"}

He could do everything but win when it mattered most. No one doubted his desire or ability, but they demonstrably weren\u0027t enough. You don\u0027t have to care about sports to realize that exceptional talent, dedication, discipline, teamwork, and hard work assure neither improvement nor victory. You also need self-awareness and smarts.\nWhat do you need to know and emulate about LeBron James\u0027 journey to championship level?\nNo, you can\u0027t hire Hakeem Olajuwon. But you can look at \"The Evolution of King James.\"\nKirk Goldsberry brilliantly describes the open secret to James\u0027 success: Nothing makes serious competitors more open to analytics than losing. A basketball genius frustrated with his professional failings decided he wasn\u0027t as good or as smart as he needed to be. James took a good hard look at the analytics (which Goldsberry brilliantly and visually illustrates) and an even better and harder look at himself. Then he hired retired NBA legend Olajuwon — the only player in NBA history to win the MVP, Finals MVP, and Defensive Player of the Year awards in the same season — to help remedy the analytically undeniable flaws and shortcomings of his game. He explicitly linked analytics to his personal/professional transformation.\n\"I wanted to get better,\" James said of his decision to work with Olajuwon. \"I wanted to improve and I sought out someone who I thought was one of the greatest low-post players to ever play this game. I was grateful and happy that he welcomed me with open arms; I was able to go down to Houston for four and a half days; I worked out twice a day; he taught me a lot about the low post and being able to gain an advantage on your opponent. I used that the rest of the off-season, when I went back to my hometown. Every day in the gym I worked on one thing or I worked on two things and tried to improve each and every day.\"\nAnd there\u0027s more to the story. The workouts were scheduled to begin each day at 9 a.m. While Olajuwon did show up regularly on time, James always was already there, sometimes having arrived by 8:20.\n\"He would be there stretched and ready to go,\" Olajuwon said. \"That says a lot about him and his determination. I was impressed that he couldn\u0027t wait to get started.\"\n\"I went there to put in work,\" James said. \"That\u0027s what it\u0027s all about. I didn\u0027t want to do anything else but to get better.\"\nNot incidentally, James brought his own videographer to record the sessions for later study and review. The Olajuwon sessions were not just \"classes\" or \"workshops\" or \"training sessions\" — they were the continuation of a transformation process rooted in the analytics. The true test of analytics isn\u0027t just on how good they are but in how committed you are to using them to improve. Of course, James didn\u0027t just make a commitment; he got one from Olajuwon. Those commitments unambiguously paid off last year.\nThe results thus far speak for themselves this year, as well. Self-improvement in teams requires teams.\nMost people reading Harvard Business Review aren\u0027t as talented in their field as James is in his. But how many of us have committed to measurable self-improvement based on analytic insight? How many of us have hired the right coach for the right reason?\nMany readers were irritated by an earlier post describing how predictive analytics would increasingly determine who companies would hire, fire, and promote. Data-driven decision-making about people and their potential seem to be the digital destiny of human capital management. But this argument leaves out a crucial variable.\nThe surest way to disrupt the quantitative tyranny of predictive analytics is demonstrable self-improvement. Individuals and organizations alike have to move away from the notion of analytics as the key to insight and towards the belief that they\u0027re the GPS of transformation. Self-improvement, not self-knowledge, is the goal.\nHave you had an analytic epiphany? Good. Now ask yourself: Who is your Hakeem Olajuwon?\n","source":"google_52778141777464"}

I certainly think so: very rarely is LeBron\u0027s defense discussed specifically and removed from his overall incredible play. We acknowledge that he\u0027s a great, versatile defender, and then we move on.\nIt\u0027s also hard to ignore team performance. Memphis had the league\u0027s No. 1 defense, with Gasol and Tony Allen getting huge chunks of credit. The Heat defense finished No. 9, and remains the team\u0027s one acknowledged weakness. So there\u0027s sort of a built-in justification against voting for LeBron there, no matter how great he is.\nWe\u0027re at the point where it\u0027s possible LeBron will never win DPOY, so he\u0027s right to be angry that he\u0027s not gotten more consideration for the award and public praise for his defensive effort. Maybe he can find Tim Duncan and commiserate: the two-time MVP has never won DPOY, either, despite battling with Kevin Garnett for best defensive big man throughout their tangled careers. (Garnett is one of three players, with MJ and Hakeem, to have both a DPOY and an MVP on his shelf. Ticket won his MVP in 2004 and DPOY in 2008.)\nIf we did the sensible thing and instituted an Offensive Player of the Year award, perhaps LeBron could swing for a grand slam in a future season ... although envisioning LeBron beating Kevin Durant for any type of offensive award, given how the world feels about KD, is a stretch.\nIn conclusion: LeBron has a point, but he\u0027s also about to have a fourth MVP, so I\u0027m not too concerned that he is underated.\nMore from SB Nation:\n","source":"google_52778141777464"}

While the results have not yet been announced, most predict James to be a close to unanimous pick for MVP honors. Needless to say, James will join a very limited group of guys by taking down the award yet again, but can he surpass them?\nOnly four players have been named league MVP four or more times in the history of the league. The list includes Wilt Chamberlain (4), Bill Russell (5), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (6) and Michael Jordan (5). Very soon, LeBron will become the fifth name on this list.\nFew all-time greats have managed to sustain such a high level of play to take down more than one or two MVP awards. Shaquille O’Neal,  Kobe Bryant, Charles Barkley, Hakeem Olajuwon and David Robinson each have just one MVP award. Despite being extremely dominant in their own eras, all these players have not managed to outshine the opposition by as much as James has.\nIt is very hard to impress the judges year in and year out like James has done. Even though LeBron deserved the MVP award in 2011, Derrick Rose took the league by storm and was named most valuable player. Simply staying at the same level is no longer enough — you have to elevate your game every single year.\nJames has done just that and we still don’t know where his skill ceiling is. The fact that he will win his fourth MVP award, while only being 28 years old and still in his prime, certainly suggests he can win a couple more. Eventually, when James’ numbers start to decline a little, he will no longer gather as many votes. He has set an extremely high standard for himself, and while he will likely remain the best player in the league for years to come, it is no guarantee that he will take down more MVP awards.\nLeBron still has two years before he hits 30, but Kevin Durant is tight on his heels. If he will ever catch up to Kareem, it will have to happen over the next two to three years.\n \nVytis is a Miami Heat and NBA columnist for RantSports.

But once you’ve seen Thunders in action, you might decide ...","text":"Manish Gosala Photography\nNicole Williams, aka Bonnie Thunders, left, is downright Jordanesque in derby.\nIf you’ve never heard of Bonnie Thunders, born Nicole Williams, anyone up to speed on the game of roller derby might call her the LeBron James of the world’s fastest-growing sport. But once you’ve seen Thunders in action, you might decide LeBron James is really the Bonnie Thunders of the NBA.\nThunders, a jammer and member of New York City’s Gotham Girls Roller Derby, came to the sport in 2006 after spending four years at Syracuse University in competitive synchronized ice skating. Since then, her career has been nothing short of Jordanesque, and she is widely regarded as the most dominant player in the game.\n“When I started, I was scrawny and I wasn’t a great player. The game was more about big hits back then,” she said. “But being in love with the sport and a control freak, I wanted to improve.”\nImprove she did.\nSince, Thunders and Gotham have won three national championships, the first in 2008, for which she was named the tournament MVP. Gotham won two more back-to-back titles, in 2011 and 2012, and have been undefeated since 2011 on the flat-track -- essentially untouchable in the sport.\nJackie Daniels, a fellow competitor who skates for Chicago’s Windy City Rollers, has faced Thunders in competition. Daniels points out that anyone playing Thunders and Gotham has their work cut out for them.\n“Gotham is amazing, top to bottom,” Daniels said. “Statistically, the points that Bonnie puts up for them destroy scoreboards.”\nOne stark example is the 2012 WFTDA Championship final versus the Olympia (Wash.) powerhouse Oly Rollers. After helping Gotham go up 51-0 in the opening 10 minutes, Thunders scored 178 of Gotham’s 233 points to lead the New York team to a crushing 233-130 victory and its third Hydra trophy.\nThunders, 29, also skated for Team USA in roller derby’s first World Cup in December 2011, in which the U.S. routed Canada 336-33 in the final. Regarding her success, Thunders hints that she’s equal parts drive and athleticism.\n“Even when I’ve had an excellent tournament season and I’m really proud of what my team has accomplished and me individually, you can always do better.”\nAlongside her drive, Thunders says the precision and fluidity required in figure skating helped make the transition to the sport and quad-style roller skates successful.\n“I feel like I’ve brought a lot of what I know from figure skating to derby,” Thunders said, “It’s about keeping a tight core and having your center of gravity under your shoulders. When I train, a lot of focus is about weight transfer and pinpointing precisely where to complete the move.”\nYet, like any player, she’s had to get stronger as the game grows more competitive. Along with plyometric exercises, Thunders said she spent time between championship seasons weight training, “working to build up body mass and muscle.\"\n“With that, I definitely felt a difference in my strength and explosive power,\" she said, \"and my ability to react in the game.”\nCourtesy of Jules Doyle\nBonnie Thunders: \u0027made of rubber bands and steel plates.\u0027\nLauren Goller, another skater who has faced Thunders, agrees that the athleticism matches her fast skates.\n“I am convinced that she is made of rubber bands and steel plates.” Goller said. “Bonnie has amazing footwork, plays very smart and can muscle her way through a wall that looks impenetrable.”\nWhat else inspires Thunders?\n“I find my motivation not so much from famous female athletes, but from my competitors and even more so from my teammates,” she said.\nOff skates, Thunders also finds inspiration in the center of the USA’s biggest sports town, New York.\n“Over the winter I saw some basketball -- Nets and Knicks games -- and it was awesome,\" said Thunders, a Brooklyn local. \"Being wrapped up in derby, I enjoyed it more than I ever thought I would. The Nets’ stadium is just crazy.”\nAccording to one estimate, more than 20,000 women in the United States play roller derby. Since its up-from-the-bootstraps revival in 2001, roller derby has grown hastily outside the U.S., creating an international conversation.\nIn 2009, Drew Barrymore’s directorial-debut film, “Whip It\" -- which featured skater Daniels as herself -- hit theaters, starring Oscar nominees Ellen Page and Juliette Lewis and Academy Award winner Marcia Gay Harden. More recently, the London Roller Girls booked a 13-episode TV show with the Extreme Sports Network, announced in January.\nRegarding the roller derby’s renaissance and her place within, Thunders weighed in.\n“Derby is established here in the U.S., but outside I see it as a machine that’s chugging along and gaining momentum pretty quickly,” Thunders said. “It’s going to go a lot of directions in the next few years. But the most moving thing has been seeing passion of new teams and international growth of the sport.”\n","source":"google_52778141777464"}

That wasn\u0027t going to happen against the Bucks.","text":"LeBron James steps up, leads Heat to second round\nMILWAUKEE (AP) -- LeBron James can cross another item off his to-do list.\nJames scored 30 points, Ray Allen had another big game against his old team and the Miami Heat got their first playoff sweep in the Big Three era, advancing to the Eastern Conference semifinals with an 88-77 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks on Sunday.\n\"It was our next big step as far as our growth,\" James said. \"It\u0027s so hard to win on the road in the playoffs, in someone\u0027s building -- especially when someone is playing for their last life. It\u0027s a big step for us.\"\nAnd now the Heat have some much-needed time to rest. Dwyane Wade sat out Sunday\u0027s game, only the second postseason game he\u0027s missed in his career, because of his aching right knee. But with Miami not playing until next Saturday, at the earliest, he\u0027ll have plenty of time to treat the three bone bruises that caused him to miss six games near the end of the regular season.\nMiami plays the winner of the Brooklyn-Chicago series. The Bulls lead that series 3-1, with Game 5 on Monday night in New York.\n\"It\u0027s big,\" Wade said of the time off. \"Obviously, we\u0027re one of the oldest teams in the league, maybe the oldest team in terms of rotation players. Guys have some bumps and bruises coming out of this series, so it\u0027s going to be great to get some rest. But also we have to take this time to continue to stay sharp, to continue to stay in shape as well.\"\nJudging by the clinical way in which the Heat dissected the Bucks in this series, that isn\u0027t likely to be a problem.\nThe defending NBA champions won each game by double digits, getting contributions from their stars and subs alike. Allen finished with 16 points, the third time in the series he scored in double figures, and was 4 of 7 from 3-point range.\nUdonis Haslem added 13 points and five rebounds, and Mario Chalmers kicked in eight rebounds and six assists for Miami, which never trailed Sunday.\n\"They had the whole package,\" Bucks coach Jim Boylan said. \"When you can afford to sit guy like Dwyane Wade and perform at the level they performed at, that\u0027s a championship-caliber team.\"\nMonta Ellis led the Bucks with 21 points, and Larry Sanders had 11 rebounds to go with seven points.\nBut Milwaukee got almost nothing again from Brandon Jennings, who didn\u0027t even play in the fourth quarter. Jennings, who had guaranteed the Bucks would win the series in six games, finished with three points on 1-of-7 shooting.\nAfter scoring 26 points in Game 1, Jennings had 27 total in the final three.\n\"Frustrated, a little down because I came into this season with so much confidence,\" he said. \"I thought we had a chance to steal a game in Game 1, Game 2. We let that slip away from us. Game 3, we came back home. Had a 10-point lead, lost that. I mean it\u0027s frustration all around.\"\nThe Heat had chances to sweep their first-round series in each of the last two seasons, taking 3-0 leads on Philadelphia (2011) and New York (2012). But they couldn\u0027t close it out, losing Game 4 each year.\nThat wasn\u0027t going to happen against the Bucks. Even with Wade reduced to a spectator.\nWade got treatment \"around the clock\" the last two days in hopes of playing Sunday, and he tested his knee before the game. But he and the Heat decided it wasn\u0027t worth risking aggravating the injury further, and he spent the entire game on the bench in his warmups.\n\"He gave me the nod saying he wasn\u0027t going to go, so I knew had to pick it up a little more and try to bring us home, bring this win home for us,\" James said.\nThat he did, adding eight rebounds, seven assists and three steals to his 30 points.\n\"We just space the floor and see if they can stop him. If not, he knows where we are,\" Allen said. \"We just give him that room to operate.\"\nThe Heat led by as many as 11 in the first half, only to see the Bucks steadily chip away at the lead. When Mike Dunleavy drained a 3 and Ellis scored on a floater, it cut Miami\u0027s lead to 69-67 with 9:34 to play.\nEllis was fouled by Allen on the play, but he missed the free throw and James grabbed the rebound. He fed Allen, who knocked down -- what else, a 3. J.J. Redick missed a long 3 and James found an open Chalmers for another 3 that gave the Heat a 75-67 lead with 8:27 left.\nThe 3 was Chalmers\u0027 80th in the postseason, tying Tim Hardaway\u0027s franchise record.\nAfter Luc Richard Mbah a Moute made the second of two free throws, James scored on a layup. Redick made a jumper, but Shane Battier and Allen closed out the Bucks with a pair of 3s. James then converted a three-point play and added a layup to complete the 19-5 run -- a spurt in which he had a hand in every single Miami score.\n\"At some point during that stretch right there, he decided he was going to put his imprint on the game and he did. In a big way,\" Boylan said. \"When you\u0027re a superstar player like he is, that\u0027s what superstar players do.\"\nNOTES: The Heat have won eight straight postseason games dating to last season. That matches the franchise record. ... NBA Commissioner David Stern was in attendance. ... James scored 30 or more for the 54th time in the postseason, second only to Kobe Bryant among active players. ... Milwaukee had seven of its 16 turnovers in the first quarter. ... The Bucks are now 20-26 in elimination games. ... Packers LB Clay Matthews was at the game.\n","source":"google_52778141777464"}

SEARCH\n \nYemen human rights minister in Washington to talk about Guantanamo detainees\nBy Adam Baron - McClatchy Foreign Staff\nBy Adam Baron\n0 comments\nSANAA, Yemen --         With a weeks-long hunger strike focusing new attention on conditions at the United States’ controversial detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the minister of human rights for Yemen is due in Washington on Friday for talks she hopes will lead to the repatriation of at least some of the scores of Yemenis held at the island prison.\nSpeaking on the eve of her trip, Hooriya Mashhour told McClatchy that the Yemeni government’s ultimate goal is to gain custody of all its citizens currently held at Guantanamo – a number that is uncertain but includes at least 84 of the 166 men imprisoned there. But she said her current hope is more modest – the return of the two dozen or so Yemenis that a special Obama administration task force determined in 2010 could be returned to their homeland.\n“At the very least, we want the release of the detainees who have been cleared – those who have already been determined to present no threat to the U.S.,” she said. “That, however, is just the first step.”\nWhat to do with the Yemenis at Guantanamo is one of the major decisions that President Barack Obama must make if he is to accomplish his first-term campaign pledge to close the detention center – a goal he reiterated at a news conference Tuesday.\nThe State Department said this week that 26 of the Yemenis at the center have been cleared for release, and that 30 others could be transferred to Yemen if the government could take “appropriate measures to reduce the risks associated with their return.” But their return is blocked by a moratorium on the transfer of any detainees to Yemen, which Obama imposed after the attempted Christmas Day 2009 midair bombing of an aircraft over Detroit. The Nigerian who confessed to that attempt said he’d been recruited for the mission by al Qaida-linked people in Yemen.\nThe White House said this week that the moratorium remains in place, even as pressure rises on Obama to do something to ease tensions at Guantanamo, where at least 100 of the detainees have refused to eat since March. Twenty-three of those are being force-fed twice daily, the Pentagon said this week, a step that has been denounced by the International Committee of the Red Cross and the American Medical Association as a violation of prisoner rights.\nThe disposition of Yemeni detainees is also a potent political issue here, where anxiety over the hunger strike is adding to anger that swept the country after the suicide in September of Yemeni detainee Adnan Latif.\nFor much of the past decade, Yemeni officials have petitioned for the detainees’ release. But they have won the return of only a handful of men under the presidency of longtime leader Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was ousted last year in the wave of Arab revolts. While U.S.-Yemeni relations have warmed under Saleh’s successor, former Vice President Abdo Rabbu Mansour Hadi, no Yemenis have been sent home, and Hadi has been sharply critical of his American allies.\nHadi has cast the Yemenis’ imprisonment without trial as “clear-cut tyranny,” while officials have noted that preparations already had begun for the detainees’ “rehabilitation” process upon return. Saudi Arabia and other countries have instituted similar programs – to mixed success – in an effort to reintegrate former Guantanamo detainees into society.\nWith whom Mashhour will meet in Washington is unclear. The State Department did not respond to requests for information. Last month, Mashhour said she would seek permission to visit the prison to see for herself the conditions of the Yemenis there. But previous requests for such a visit have been denied, and Pentagon spokesman Todd Breasseale said Thursday he was unaware of any current request from Mashhour to visit Guantanamo.\nBreasseale said such visits typically are restricted to foreign intelligence and law enforcement officials.\nMashhour’s delegation includes officials from Yemen’s intelligence service and the Foreign Ministry, she said.\nBarron is a McClatchy special correspondent.

REUTERS/Bob Strong\nBy Matt Spetalnick\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Saying it was damaging to U.S. interests to keep holding prisoners in legal limbo at Guantanamo, President Barack Obama renewed an old vow on Tuesday to close the camp, where about 100 inmates are on hunger strike to protest against their years in detention without trial.\nHuman rights groups welcomed Obama\u0027s recommitment to shutting the prison, but some activists called for action, not just words.\nCriticism of the camp, set up at the U.S. Naval Base in Cuba in 2002 to hold foreign terrorism suspects and now housing 166 inmates, has intensified in recent weeks as the U.S. military is force-feeding some of those on hunger strike.\nObama, who repeatedly pledged to close the camp when he was campaigning for a first term and after he first took office in 2009, put the blame on Congress for his failure to make good on his promise and said he would re-engage with lawmakers on the issue.\nAt a White House news conference, he lamented the status quo, which has kept most prisoners in detention without trial or charge for more than a decade, but offered no new path to overcoming the political and legal obstacles.\n\"It\u0027s not sustainable - I mean, the notion that we\u0027re going to continue to keep over 100 individuals in a no-man\u0027s land in perpetuity,\" Obama said.\nHis comments were his first public remarks about Guantanamo since the hunger strike began in early February. Military officials have attributed the protest action in part to a sense of hopelessness among detainees over their open-ended detention.\nLong a subject of international condemnation but low on the list of the American public\u0027s policy concerns, Guantanamo returned to the spotlight with the hunger strike. Some inmates have given harrowing accounts of force-feeding and human rights groups have denounced the practice.\nObama defended the military\u0027s decision to force-feed hunger strikers, saying \"I don\u0027t want these individuals to die.\"\nThe U.S. military has said 21 prisoners are being force-fed liquid meals through tubes inserted in their noses and down into their stomachs. Forty medical personnel have been sent to reinforce the military\u0027s existing teams at Guantanamo to deal with the hunger strike.\nVIOLATION OF MEDICAL ETHICS\nThe force-feeding has been criticized by rights groups and also by the American Medical Association. On Thursday, the president of the AMA sent a letter to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel reiterating the association\u0027s position that it is a violation of medical ethics to force-feed mentally competent adults who refuse food and life-saving treatment.\nAsked about the hunger strike, Obama said it was \"not a surprise to me that we\u0027ve got problems in Guantanamo\" and ticked off a list of reasons why the camp should be shut down.\n\"Guantanamo is not necessary to keep America safe,\" he said. \"It is expensive. It is inefficient. It hurts us, in terms of our international standing. It lessens cooperation with our allies on counter-terrorism efforts. It is a recruitment tool for extremists. It needs to be closed.\"\nObama said he had asked his advisers to \"examine every option that we have administratively\" to deal with Guantanamo. It was unclear whether that meant Obama might use executive powers that some legal experts say he has to transfer some detainees.\nU.S. Senator Patrick Leahy, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, backed Obama\u0027s effort. \"The deteriorating situation at Guantanamo, including the ongoing and expanding hunger strikes by prisoners ... is disturbing and unacceptable,\" he said.\nBut Howard McKeon, Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, said: \"The president faces bipartisan opposition to closing Guantanamo Bay\u0027s detention center because he has offered no alternative plan regarding the detainees there, nor a plan for future terrorist captures.\"\nObama has approved military tribunals to try some of the most dangerous suspects, but only nine of the current prisoners have been charged or convicted of crimes.\nOf the other inmates, 86 have been cleared for transfer or release, 47 are considered too dangerous to release but are not facing prosecution and 24 are considered eligible for possible prosecution.\nU.S. lawmakers, mostly Republicans but including some Democrats, have blocked Obama from transferring Guantanamo prisoners to American jails, saying they would pose a security risk if housed in the United States. They have also made it difficult to repatriate others.\nThe U.S. government will not send some prisoners back to their homelands because of instability or concerns over mistreatment. Most countries are reluctant to accept them for resettlement when the United States itself will not take them.\nObama said ultimately he would need approval from Congress to shutter the facility and acknowledged that would be an uphill struggle, saying, \"It\u0027s easy to demagogue the issue.\"\nZeke Johnson, director of Amnesty International USA\u0027s Security with Human Rights Campaign, issued a statement saying: \"President Obama is right to recommit to closing Guantanamo. But it\u0027s time to do more than talk. Instead of sending more medics to force-feed detainees, a process that can amount to ill-treatment, he should take concrete steps to keep his promise to close the detention facility.\"\n\"WAIVER PROCESS\"\nThe Center for Constitutional Rights said: \"We praise the president for reaffirming his commitment to closing the base but take issue with the impression he strives to give that it is largely up to Congress.\"\nIt said that if Obama were \"really serious\" about closing Guantanamo, he could use a \"waiver process\" to transfer some of the detainees who have already been cleared for release, lift the moratorium on transfers to Yemen and appoint a senior administration official to shepherd the closure.\nThe United States has not sent prisoners back to Yemen, where 56 of those eligible for release are from, since a foiled plot in 2010 to bomb an American passenger aircraft was hatched my militants in Yemen.\nThe Guantanamo camp was opened by Republican President George W. Bush, to hold foreign terrorism suspects captured overseas after the September 11 attacks on the United States in 2001.\nObama failed to meet his promise to close the prison within a year of taking office in early 2009 and it has become an enduring symbol of widely condemned U.S. interrogation and detention practices during the Bush era.\nAn independent U.S. task force issued a report on April 16 calling indefinite detention of prisoners at Guantanamo \"abhorrent and intolerable.\" It called for the camp to be closed by the end of 2014 when NATO\u0027s combat mission in Afghanistan is due to end and most U.S. troops will leave the country.\nThe U.S. military on Monday counted 100 prisoners as hunger strikers. Five of those being force-fed have been hospitalized for observation but did not have life-threatening conditions, a spokesman for the detention camp, Army Lieutenant Colonel Samuel House, said on Tuesday.\nA few Guantanamo detainees are allowed to watch television and likely saw Obama\u0027s news conference, he said.\n\"We are confident that some saw it, but much of the talk was about Boston,\" House said, referring to Obama\u0027s remarks about the Boston Marathon bombings on April 15. \"We are sure that word will get around very quickly.\"\nHunger strikes have occurred at Guantanamo since shortly after the United States began detaining suspected al Qaeda and Taliban captives there in January 2002.\nThe current hunger strike began in early February, after guards seized photos and other belongings during a cell search. Prisoners said the guards had mistreated their Korans during the search. The U.S. military has denied that.\n(Additional reporting by Jane Sutton in Miami.; Editing by Frances Kerry and Christopher Wilson)\nLoading...\n","source":"google_52778142459199"}

(REUTERS/Khaled Abdullah) “I will not eat until they restore my dignity.” That’s what Samir Naji al Hasan Moqbel told ...","text":"The Editors\nDays later, The Guardian published a letter from another hunger striker, Shaker Aamer, whose words cut to the heart of the protest. “As of today, I’ve spent more than 11 years in Guantánamo Bay,” he wrote. “To be precise, it’s been 4,084 long days and nights. I’ve never been charged with any crime.”\nMoqbel and Aamer are among the eighty-six prisoners languishing at the prison despite having long been cleared for release. Moqbel, like most of these men, hails from Yemen; after the failed 2009 suicide attack by the so-called “underwear bomber,” who trained in Yemen, the White House implemented a policy of caging its Yemeni detainees indefinitely. The fact that fifty-six are apparently innocent of any crime is of little concern; in March, State Department adviser Michael Williams told the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights that the Yemenis will stay in Guantánamo for “the foreseeable future.”\nSuch cruelty breeds desperation. Last year, Adnan Latif was finally sent home to Yemen in a coffin after almost eleven years; he had ostensibly overdosed on pills. Since the hunger strike began, at least two men have attempted suicide. “I do not want to die here,” wrote Moqbel, “but until President Obama and Yemen’s president do something, that is what I risk every day.” On April 1, Yemeni protesters held posters of their imprisoned loved ones outside the US Embassy in Saana.\nThe Pentagon, which once called prisoner suicides “asymmetric warfare,” has dismissed the hunger strike as a publicity stunt. Rather than “reward bad behavior,” the official response has been to throw the men into solitary confinement and keep the most weakened alive through torturous means. Moqbel described how eight members of the prison’s Extreme Reaction Force tied him to a hospital bed, forced an IV into his hand and left him there for twenty-six hours. More than twenty men are now slated for force-feeding, which means being strapped to a chair and having tubes carrying a liquid diet shoved into their noses. In late April, forty “medical reinforcements” arrived on the island to assist.\n“I don’t want these individuals to die,” Obama told reporters on April 30, adding that “the Pentagon is trying to manage the situation as best as they can.” He also recommitted to closing Guantánamo, calling on Congress to “step up and help.”\nReading this for free? Chip in—fight the right with our reader-supported journalism.\nIt’s true that lawmakers on both sides have fought hard to make transfers impossible. But Obama’s words ignored how his own policies set the stage for the crisis. “He has said the right thing before,” Guantánamo lawyer Pardiss Kebriaei of the Center for Constitutional Rights told The Nation. “It’s time now for action.” The CCR is calling on Obama to end his “self-imposed moratorium” on releasing Yemenis and resume prisoner transfers. It has also called for Obama to appoint a senior official to “shepherd the process of closure.”\nAs the hunger strike approaches its hundredth day on May 17, more than 100 of Guantánamo’s 166 prisoners are refusing food. The president must start living up to his rhetoric about closing the prison, the CCR warns, or “the men who are on hunger strike will die, and he will be ultimately responsible for their deaths.”\n","source":"google_52778142459199"}

The effort was halted in 2010 after a man trained by militants in Yemen attempted to bomb a U.S.-bound plane in 2009 with a bomb concealed in his underwear.\nYemen itself is in the frontline of the fight against al Qaeda, with Washington providing military support including drone strikes at militants operating mainly in the south.\nThe White House insists it wants the facility shut but says restrictions by Congress remain an obstacle.\nSome releases would need senior U.S. officials to certify that countries receiving an inmate were willing and able to stop the individual from acting against the United States - a guarantee few U.S. politicians would want to give.\nAsked if measures taken by new Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to confront al Qaeda would help restart the transfers, White House spokesman Jay Carney said he had no new information on the detainees.\nCaitlin Hayden, White House National Security Council spokesman, blamed Congress for the impasse.\nPOLITICAL WILL\nHuman rights lawyers say the restrictions put in place by Congress are not the full story.\nCori Crider, legal director of Reprieve, a British-based charity which represents detainees, blamed a lack of political will by the Obama administration, which she said feared being seen as weak on security.\n\"Where there is no political will, suddenly the administrative obstacles are important and everyone is concerned about meeting Congressional reporting requirements. But when there is political will, no one cares about that,\" she said.\nDavid Remes, a U.S. lawyer who acts for detainees, told the Yemeniaty.com website their plight could not compete with Obama\u0027s domestic policy priorities like immigration reform and gun control.\n\"It is a big issue as far as principle is concerned, but in terms of practical politics, it\u0027s a tick on a camel\u0027s back.\"\nAl-Shabati\u0027s family says he has never been convicted of any crime despite being held in Guantanamo for more than 12 years.\nThey say the 30-year-old - 18 when he was arrested in southern Pakistan and handed to the United States - was a victim of an indiscriminate crackdown on foreigners with suspected al Qaeda ties. He was in Pakistan to study, they say.\nMohammed said a U.S. military review panel cleared Abdelrahman in 2008 of charges of being an enemy combatant - a term normally apply to suspected al Qaeda militants - but efforts to win his repatriation had been fruitless.\n\"The Yemeni government says the U.S. government does not want to hand them over and the Americans say Yemen does not want to take them,\" Mohammed said. \"We no longer believe anyone.\"\nYemenis complain that their government has not been pushing enough to ensure the return of its citizens.\nMohammed said the family has grown more worried about Abdelrahman\u0027s health following the hunger strike, now in its third month.

About 11 Saudis freed from Guantanamo later quit a Saudi rehabilitation program and disappeared, security analysts say.\n\"Those who returned to al Qaeda did so because they were kept under constant harassment by security forces and found the doors (for normal life) closed,\" Barman said.\nThe Yemeni government says talks with the U.S. government over the fate of the prisoners are making progress.\nRajeh Badi, an aid to Yemeni Prime Minister Mohammed Basindwa, said work was underway on an $11 million centre to hold the prisoners while they undergo a rehabilitation program to ensure they did not return to al Qaeda.\n\"We object to sending Yemeni prisoners anywhere but to their home country,\" Badi said. \"The government will be responsible for caring for them and rehabilitating them.\"\n(Additional reporting by William Maclean in Dubai and Roberta Rampton in Washington, Writing by Sami Aboudi, Editing by Angus MacSwan)\n","source":"google_52778142459199"}

U.S. prison officials would respond as have U.S. military authorities at Gitmo, letting the prisoners protest by not eating, but not letting them die -- instead, restraining them, if necessary, and administering the nutrition their bodies require.\nIn any case, the option of sending detainees from the detention facility at Guantanamo to prisons in America is moot for now because Congress, on a bipartisan basis, is adamantly opposed. Four years ago this month, the Senate voted 90-6 against spending the money necessary to close the Gitmo prison.\nA second option: Let the detainees go. A little background may clarify why this, too, is not feasible. The Bush administration brought 779 prisoners to Guantanamo. By the time Obama became president, there were 240 left. Almost two-thirds had been transferred to their home countries or to a third country willing to take responsibility for them. But in some cases, neither of those options was available because it is U.S. policy not to turn detainees over to regimes that might summarily execute or otherwise abuse them.\nDuring Obama\u0027s tenure, additional detainees have been shipped out. Of the 166 who remain, 46 are considered too dangerous to release or transfer.\nThat leaves 86 detainees \"designated for transfer if security conditions can be met.\" That does not imply that they are innocent. It does not even imply that U.S. authorities are convinced they no longer pose a threat. On the contrary, of those released from Gitmo to date, an estimated 27 percent have returned to terrorist activities.\nOf the 86 \"designated for transfer,\" more than 50 come from Yemen. As The New York Times has reported, \"Mr. Obama himself has indefinitely barred further repatriations (to Yemen) ... because of Yemen\u0027s active al-Qaida branch.\" That branch targets both Americans and the Yemeni government we\u0027re attempting to support.\nObama\u0027s decision seems sensible to me but not to The Washington Post\u0027s foreign-affairs blogger, Max Fisher, who calls the situation \"almost Kafkaesque in its cruel absurdity.\" He asks if there isn\u0027t something \"distasteful and unsettling about imprisoning people not because they\u0027ve done anything wrong but because they might in the future?\" He does not appear to understand that he\u0027s talking about members of al-Qaida, the Taliban and affiliated groups -- not goat herders who were heading to a cousin\u0027s wedding in Afghanistan when they got caught up in the malevolent maw of the U.S. military.\nIn times of war, presidents have the authority to kill the enemy. In the past, those captured rather than killed were considered lucky. It makes no sense -- legally, morally, logically -- to say that an enemy whom the president can kill with a drone or a SEAL team suddenly undergoes a metamorphosis (speaking of Kafka) transforming him into an innocent-until-proven-guilty suspect in a criminal investigation if he is handcuffed rather than buried.\nAnd should our troops come to understand that anyone they capture rather than kill is likely to be pointing a gun at them again before long, they will be incentivized to use lethal force with increased frequency. Would that be preferable from a human-rights perspective?\nFinal point: When Fisher referred to Kafka, he was doubtless thinking of \"The Trial,\" the story of a man arrested by a shadowy authority who conceals the nature of his crime. But Kafka also wrote \"The Hunger Artist,\" about a performer who sits in a cage for weeks on end without eating.

Instead, they insist, his decade-long detention at the U.S. Navy base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, is little more than a case of terrible luck.\nShabati, they say, was studying in Pakistan when he was picked up in a raid on a mosque in 2002 and dispatched to Guantánamo.\nIn the 10 years that Shabatis been held, life has moved on. His siblings have married and his daughter has grown up. Now Shabatis parents have become part of a new push by the Yemeni government to win the release of the 90 Yemenis being held at Guantánamo.\nLast week, Shabatis parents traveled from their home 60 miles outside Yemens capital, Sanaa, to protest outside the U.S. Embassy here. In the coming weeks, a delegation of senior Yemeni officials  including the countrys foreign minister and its minister of human rights, as well as intelligence officers  is hoping to visit Guantánamo, where dozens of detainees currently are conducting a hunger strike to protest their indefinite imprisonment without trial.\nEven Yemens president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who generally enjoys close relations with the United States, has directed rare criticism at the Obama administration.\nWe believe that keeping someone in prison for over 10 years without due process is clear-cut tyranny, Hadi said in a recent interview broadcast over the Arabic language channel of Russia Today. The United States is fond of talking democracy and human rights. But when we were discussing the prisoner issue with the American attorney general, he had nothing to say.\nPentagon spokesman Army Lt. Col. Todd Breasseale said the U.S. does not comment on communications with foreign governments about Guantánamo or the cases of individual detainees who have not been charged with a crime. He said he was unaware of any previous visit to Guantánamo by foreign officials, except members of a countrys intelligence or law enforcement services.\nIn an interview with McClatchy, Hooria Mashhour, Yemens minister of human rights, cast the ongoing hunger strike as the catalyst for seeking to visit Guantánamo. At least 41 of the 166 detainees at there are refusing food, the Pentagon has said, in a protest that U.S. officials say began in March and that lawyers for the detainees say began in February.\nBut Mashour said that ultimately Yemen wants Obama to fulfill his previous promise to close the detention center and either send the detainees home or have them face criminal charges.\nFor them to spend such a long time without trial is simply lawless, she said. Mashour said that was especially true of the 25 Yemenis, including Shabati, whom she said the United States has cleared for release but is still holding.\nOn Friday, the United Nations top human rights official, Navi Pillay, reiterated her calls that the detention center be closed. The continuing indefinite incarceration of many of the detainees amounts to arbitrary detention and is in clear breach of international law, she said.\nShe said she welcomed Obama administration officials statements that closing Guantánamo is still a goal of the administration, more than four years after a then newly inaugurated Obama ordered the detention center shut. But she expressed disappointment that nothing has been done and that Obama in January signed a defense appropriations bill into law that contained more restrictions on Obamas ability to release detainees and bring others to trial before civil courts.\nBaron is a McClatchy special correspondent.

At least 89 are Yemeni, many of whom were captured more than a decade ago.\nInternational human rights groups have over the years condemned the prison, the harsh treatment of inmates, and the dubious legality of the system.\nGuantanamo is back in the spotlight after a clash between guards and prisoners this month and the release of accounts by inmates about the force-feeding of hunger strikers.\nLegal and political hurdles stand in the way of closing the facility, including U.S. fears inmates may rejoin al Qaeda if they go home.\nThe United States began repatriating Yemeni prisoners after Obama\u0027s election in 2008. The effort was halted in 2010 after a man trained by militants in Yemen attempted to bomb a U.S.-bound plane in 2009 with a bomb concealed in his underwear.\nYemen itself is in the frontline of the fight against al Qaeda, with Washington providing military support including drone strikes at militants operating mainly in the south.\nThe White House insists it wants the facility shut but says restrictions by Congress remain an obstacle.\nSome releases would need senior U.S. officials to certify that countries receiving an inmate were willing and able to stop the individual from acting against the United States - a guarantee few U.S. politicians would want to give.\nAsked if measures taken by new Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to confront al Qaeda would help restart the transfers, White House spokesman Jay Carney said he had no new information on the detainees.\nCaitlin Hayden, White House National Security Council spokesman, blamed Congress for the impasse.\nPOLITICAL WILL\nHuman rights lawyers say the restrictions put in place by Congress are not the full story.\nCori Crider, legal director of Reprieve, a British-based charity which represents detainees, blamed a lack of political will by the Obama administration, which she said feared being seen as weak on security.\n\"Where there is no political will, suddenly the administrative obstacles are important and everyone is concerned about meeting Congressional reporting requirements. But when there is political will, no one cares about that,\" she said.\nDavid Remes, a U.S. lawyer who acts for detainees, told the Yemeniaty.com website their plight could not compete with Obama\u0027s domestic policy priorities like immigration reform and gun control.\n\"It is a big issue as far as principle is concerned, but in terms of practical politics, it\u0027s a tick on a camel\u0027s back.\"\nAl-Shabati\u0027s family says he has never been convicted of any crime despite being held in Guantanamo for more than 12 years.\nThey say the 30-year-old - 18 when he was arrested in southern Pakistan and handed to the United States - was a victim of an indiscriminate crackdown on foreigners with suspected al Qaeda ties. He was in Pakistan to study, they say.\nMohammed said a U.S. military review panel cleared Abdelrahman in 2008 of charges of being an enemy combatant - a term normally apply to suspected al Qaeda militants - but efforts to win his repatriation had been fruitless.\n\"The Yemeni government says the U.S. government does not want to hand them over and the Americans say Yemen does not want to take them,\" Mohammed said. \"We no longer believe anyone.\"\nYemenis complain that their government has not been pushing enough to ensure the return of its citizens.\nMohammed said the family has grown more worried about Abdelrahman\u0027s health following the hunger strike, now in its third month. Washington says 17 are being force-fed.\nIn an op-ed in the New York Times this month, a Yemeni man gave a dramatic account of force feeding and prison conditions.\nSamir Najal al Hasan Moqbel, who said he has been held for 11 years and three months without charges, wrote he had lost about 30 pounds since he began to refuse food on February 10.\nAt a coffee shop in Sanaa, Bandar al-Qatta\u0027a said his brother Mansour had joined the hunger strike because he lost hope of being freed after a decade in jail without trial.\n\"We hope human conscience will move to help us secure their release. Those people have never been convicted of any crime,\" said Bandar, a Saudi-born Yemeni who campaigns for the inmates.\n\"CONSTANT HARASSMENT\"\nYemeni rights activists say a U.S. military committee that studied the cases of the inmates had recommended that 58 of the Yemenis at Guantanamo prison be returned home.\nAbdelrahman Barman, a Yemeni human rights attorney, said the United States had demanded that the Yemenis be sent to Qatar or to Saudi Arabia to ensure they did not return home to join al Qaeda. About 11 Saudis freed from Guantanamo later quit a Saudi rehabilitation program and disappeared, security analysts say.\n\"Those who returned to al Qaeda did so because they were kept under constant harassment by security forces and found the doors (for normal life) closed,\" Barman said.\nThe Yemeni government says talks with the U.S. government over the fate of the prisoners are making progress.\nRajeh Badi, an aid to Yemeni Prime Minister Mohammed Basindwa, said work was underway on an $11 million centre to hold the prisoners while they undergo a rehabilitation program to ensure they did not return to al Qaeda.\n\"We object to sending Yemeni prisoners anywhere but to their home country,\" Badi said. \"The government will be responsible for caring for them and rehabilitating them.\"\n(Additional reporting by William Maclean in Dubai and Roberta Rampton in Washington, Writing by Sami Aboudi, Editing by Angus MacSwan)\n","source":"google_52778142459199"}

In addition, the World Medical Association prohibits its physicians from participating in force-feeding and the American Medical Association has just sent a letter to the Pentagon calling the practice an affront to accepted medical ethics.\nRights Groups Call Out Obama\u0027s Political Cowardice on Guantanamo\nU.S. President Barack Obama stated at a press conference on Tuesday that he would like to shut down the Guantanamo Bay prison but said that Congress was to blame for blockading any such action.\nHowever, rights groups are calling Obama\u0027s bluff, saying he actually does have the power to transfer detainees and put an end to the indefinite detention, solitary confinement, and torture inherent within the military prison—without the approval of Congress—and that he simply lacks the political courage to do so.\nCCR Demands Obama Take Action Available to Him to Close Gitmo: Use Waiver, Transfer 86 Cleared Men, Lift Yemen Repatriations Ban  \nThe Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) released the following statement in response to the president’s comments.\nAfter representing men at Guantanamo whose hopes for justice have been raised and dashed so many times over the last eleven years, we praise the president for re-affirming his commitment to closing the base but take issue with the impression he strives to give that it is largely up to Congress. Here is a prescription for what he himself can begin to do today if he is really serious about closing the prison.\nCongress is certainly responsible for imposing unprecedented restrictions on detainee transfers, but President Obama still has the power to transfer men right now. He should use the certification/waiver process created by Congress to transfer detainees, starting with the 86 men who have been cleared for release, including our client Djamel Ameziane.\nCongress may have tied one hand behind his back, but he has tied the other: he should lift his self-imposed moratorium on transfers to Yemen regardless of a detainee\u0027s status. It\u0027s collective punishment based on citizenship, and needs to be reevaluated now.\nPresident Obama should appoint a senior government official to shepherd the process of closure, and should give that person sufficient authority to resolve inter-agency disputes.\nThe President must demonstrate immediate, tangible progress toward the closure of Guantanamo or the men who are on hunger strike will die, and he will be ultimately responsible for their deaths.\nAs Bangladesh Toll Hits 400, Calls Grow to Grant Workers the Same Protections as Labels They Make\nWe found dogs and cats were being killed in China for fur collars in the Burlington Coat Factory company. They were putting nice fur collars on their jackets, and the fur came from dogs—killing dogs and cats in China. The U.S. Congress went berserk and passed a bill that nobody is going to kill dogs and cats on our watch. You can’t import dog fur or cat fur to the U.S. You can’t export it. You can’t sell it. So, there’s a precedent there. Our Congress had a backbone to protect dogs and cats. We need the same backbone to protect the rights of workers.\nWe have—there’s no reason in the world why the American people and the people in the United—Europe and U.K. and Australia or in Canada—there’s no reason that we can’t stand up and say, \"If we can protect dogs and cats, we sure as heck can protect the rights of human beings,\" and we give these workers the rights—not setting wages, wages set in Bangladesh or they’re set in Cambodia or Vietnam or anywhere, but workers will have their internationally recognized worker rights so that they can organize a union and protect themselves. And Barack Obama, or then-Senator Barack Obama, endorsed this. So did Hillary Clinton. So did Joe Biden. We had about 27 members in the Senate. We had up to 170 members in the House—until the corporations found out what we were doing with the Decent Working Conditions and Fair Competition Act. Nothing is going to change until there’s laws. The codes of conduct are so ridiculous. And it’s—people should be embarrassed talking about these codes of conduct. We need laws.\nThe more things change...\nBudget Cuts Devastate Meals On Wheels: Enrollment Slashed, Services Cancelled\nCongress recently passed a bill to undo furloughs at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) caused by sequestration, but it  left cuts to many other programs intact, including Meals on Wheels. The program brings hot meals to homebound seniors and adults with disabilities, thus providing them with nutrition and helping many of them live independently.\nDirectors of Meals on Wheels programs across the country spoke with ThinkProgress about how they are coping with decreased funding. Some, like Meals on Wheels of Western Broome in New York, are private nonprofits that don’t rely on government funding and will therefore be shielded. But by and large, the heads of these programs described facing deep cuts after having already slimmed down in response to lean times over the past few years.\n2 More Grad Students Claim To Find Another Flaw In Reinhart-Rogoff Research\nFirst, University of Massachusetts-Amherst grad student Thomas Herndon shot holes in their influential research paper, \"Growth In A Time Of Debt,\" by pointing out several mistakes and omissions the Harvard economists had made. Now, two PhD students at the University of Missouri-Kansas City have a new paper that they say finds another flaw in that same research.\nThe students argue that Reinhart and Rogoff\u0027s paper leaned too heavily on data from one country, Japan, leading to all sorts of bad conclusions about the relationship between government debt and economic growth.\n\"The argument that high ratios of government debt-to-GDP cause low growth remains plagued by misconceptions, at least for nations which issue their own currency,\" wrote the UMKC students, Matthew Berg and Brian Hartley. They used the same data that Herndon used, correcting for Reinhart and Rogoff\u0027s earlier errors and omissions.\nBerg and Hartley argued that, once you adjust for the outsize influence of Japan on the data, there is no evidence that high debt causes slow growth, as Reinhart and Rogoff strongly suggested in their original paper and in subsequent influential op-ed pieces. In fact, there is some evidence that the chain of events may work in the other direction, with slow growth leading to higher debt, Berg and Hartley wrote.\nThe Austerity Delusion\nUnable to take constructive action toward any common end, the U.S. Congress has recently been reduced to playing an ongoing game of chicken with the American economy. The debt-ceiling debacle gave way to the “fiscal cliff,” which morphed into the across-the-board cuts in military and discretionary spending known as “sequestration.” Whatever happens next on the tax front, further cuts in spending seem likely. And so a modified form of the austerity that has characterized policymaking in Europe since 2010 is coming to the United States as well; the only questions are how big the hit will end up being and who will bear the brunt. What makes all this so absurd is that the European experience has shown yet again why joining the austerity club is exactly the wrong thing for a struggling economy to do. ...\nAusterity is a seductive idea because of the simplicity of its core claim -- that you can’t cure debt with more debt. This is true as far as it goes, but it does not go far enough. Three less obvious factors undermine the simple argument that countries in the red need to stop spending. The first factor is distributional, since the effects of austerity are felt differently across different levels of society. Those at the bottom of the income distribution lose proportionately more than those at the top, because they rely far more on government services and have little wealth with which to cushion the blows. The 400 richest Americans own more assets than the poorest 150 million; the bottom 15 percent, some 46 million people, live in households earning less than $22,050 per year. Trying to get the lower end of the income distribution to pay the price of austerity through cuts in public spending is both cruel and mathematically difficult. Those who can pay won’t, while those who can’t pay are being asked to do so.\nThe second factor is compositional; everybody cannot cut their way to growth at the same time. To put this in the European context, although it makes sense for any one state to reduce its debt, if all states in the currency union, which are one another’s major trading partners, cut their spending simultaneously, the result can only be a contraction of the regional economy as a whole. Proponents of austerity are blind to this danger because they get the relationship between saving and spending backward. They think that public frugality will eventually promote private spending. But someone has to spend for someone else to save, or else the saver will have no income to hold on to. Similarly, for a country to benefit from a reduction in its domestic wages, thus becoming more competitive on costs, there must be another country willing to spend its money on what the first country produces. If all states try to cut or save at once, as is the case in the eurozone today, then no one is left to do the necessary spending to drive growth.\nThe third factor is logical; the notion that slashing government spending boosts investor confidence does not stand up to scrutiny. As the economist Paul Krugman and others have argued, this claim assumes that consumers anticipate and incorporate all government policy changes into their lifetime budget calculations. When the government signals that it plans to cut its expenditures dramatically, the argument goes, consumers realize that their future tax burdens will decrease. This leads them to spend more today than they would have done without the cuts, thereby ending the recession despite the collapse of the economy going on all around them. The assumption that this behavior will actually be exhibited by financially illiterate, real-world consumers who are terrified of losing their jobs in the midst of a policy-induced recession is heroic at best and foolish at worst.\n\u0027The Gilded Age\u0027 Statistics Corporations Don\u0027t Want Workers, or Anyone, to See\nIf there\u0027s one thing about what many are calling the \"The New Gilded Age,\" it\u0027s that well-known corporations—not to mention less well-known, but extremely powerful ones—will fight extremely hard to keep secret just how lopsided the economic disparities have become in recent decades between low-paid workers in the society and the executive and ruling class that have reaped the words of a globalized, top-heavy economy.\nIn but one example, the CEO of JC Penny in 2011 made 1,795 times the amount of money as the average paid worker at the retail chain. Overall, the CEO-to-worker gap is up nearly 20 percent since 2009. What the numbers show, once again, is that in the US economy, some workers are more equal than others.\nAnd as Bloomberg news reports, new disclosure laws designed to reveal the income gap between top executives and regular workers within their companies has been stonewalled by an aggressive lobbying effort at the Security and Exchange Commission. Among the corporations waging war against requirements imposed by the Dodd-Frank financial law are McDonald\u0027s, General Electric, and AT\u0026T—all led, according to Bloomberg, by \"a Washington-based non-profit called the HR Policy Association, which represents top human resources executives at about 335 large corporations.\"\nObama Picks One of Telecom\u0027s Most Powerful Industry Lobbyists to Head FCC\nReports that President Obama will soon nominate a former venture capitalist and head of powerful tech industry lobbying groups as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission was met with dismay by groups pushing for a more progressive choice to fill the vacant seat at the powerful regulatory agency.\nThe president\u0027s pick, Tom Wheeler, has served as both an informal adviser and key fundraiser for Obama and was for many years the head of two powerful industry associations. ...\nCraig Aaron, president of the media reform group Free Press, was quick to question the troublesome choice of someone with such deep ties to the telecom industry, big finance, and the elite political machine of the Democratic Party.\n\"The Federal Communications Commission needs a strong leader — someone who will use this powerful position to stand up to industry giants and protect the public interest,\" said Aaron. \"On paper, Tom Wheeler does not appear to be that person.\"\nJudge Sentenced to 28 Years in Prison for \"Selling\" Kids to Private Prisons\nAccused of perpetrating a “profound evil,” former Pennsylvania judge Mark Ciavarella Jr. has been sentenced to 28 years in prison for illegally accepting money from a juvenile-prison developer while he spent years incarcerating thousands of young people.\nProsecutors said Ciavarella sent juveniles to jail as part of a “kids for cash” scheme involving Robert Mericle, builder of the PA and Western PA Child Care juvenile detention centers. The ex-judge was convicted in February of 12 counts that included racketeering, money laundering, mail fraud and tax evasion. ...\nOnce the case against Ciavarella surfaced, special investigative panels began reviewing cases he handled from 2003 to 2008. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court concluded that he denied about 5,000 juveniles, some as young as ten, their constitutional rights, leading to the vacating of their convictions.\nNestlé is Trying to Patent the Fennel Flower\nNigella sativa — more commonly known as fennel flower — has been used as a cure-all remedy for over a thousand years. It treats everything from vomiting to fevers to skin diseases, and has been widely available in impoverished communities across the Middle East and Asia.\nBut now Nestlé is claiming to own it, and filing patent claims around the world to try and take control over the natural cure of the fennel flower and turn it into a costly private drug.\n","source":"google_52778142459199"}

Instead, they insist, his decadelong detention at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is little more than a case of terrible luck.\nAl-Shabati, they say, was studying in Pakistan when he was picked up in a raid on a mosque in 2002 and dispatched to Guantanamo.\nIn the 10 years that al-Shabati has been held, life has moved on. His siblings have married and his daughter has grown up. Now al-Shabati’s parents have become part of a new push by the Yemeni government to win the release of the 90 Yemenis being held at Guantanamo.\nLast week, al-Shabati’s parents traveled from their home 60 miles outside Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, to protest outside the U.S. Embassy here. In the coming weeks, a delegation of senior Yemeni officials – including the country’s foreign minister and its minister of human rights, as well as intelligence officers – is hoping to visit Guantanamo Bay, where dozens of detainees currently are conducting a hunger strike to protest their indefinite imprisonment without trial.\nEven Yemen’s president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who generally enjoys close relations with the United States, has directed rare criticism at the Obama administration.\n“We believe that keeping someone in prison for over 10 years without due process is clear-cut tyranny,” Hadi said in a recent interview broadcast over the Arabic language channel of Russia Today. “The United States is fond of talking democracy and human rights. But when we were discussing the prisoner issue with the American attorney general, he had nothing to say.”\nPentagon spokesman Army Lt. Col. Todd Breasseale said the U.S. does not comment on communications with foreign governments about Guantanamo or the cases of individual detainees who have not been charged with a crime. He said he was unaware of any previous visit to Guantanamo by foreign officials, except members of a country’s intelligence or law enforcement services.\nIn an interview with McClatchy Newspapers, Hooria Mashhour, Yemen’s minister of human rights, cast the ongoing hunger strike as the catalyst for seeking to visit Guantanamo. At least 41 of the 166 detainees at Guantanamo are refusing food, the Pentagon has said, in a protest that U.S. officials say began in March and that lawyers for the detainees say began in February.\nBut Mashour said that ultimately Yemen wants Obama to fulfill his previous promise to close the Guantanamo detention center and either send the detainees home or have them face criminal charges.\n“For them to spend such a long time without trial is simply lawless,” she said. Mashour said that was especially true of the 25 Yemenis, including al-Shabati, whom she said the United States has cleared for release but is still holding.\nAnger has been growing in Yemen over the continued detention without trial of Yemenis at Guantanamo since the September suicide of Yemeni detainee Adnan Latif, who once had won a court ruling from a U.S. district judge ordering his release but whose victory was overturned by an appeals court.\nRoughly 90 Yemeni citizens are still being held at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. The Yemenis form the largest group of detainees at the prison.\n","source":"google_52778142459199"}

Or tweet me @ RachaelMBade and follow @ POLITICOPro . \nTODAY’S MUST READS:\n1.) DEMS WORRIED ABOUT OBAMACARE. The Democratic Party may have written and ultimately ushered Obamacare into law, but now its members are nervous about the health overhaul, David Nather and Darren Samuelsohn report for Pro. One big reason why: mid-term elections. “[D]uring at least two meetings with administration officials last week, Democrats told the White House they don’t like how the law’s implementation and messaging are going. It\u0027s no wonder why: On Tuesday, a Kaiser Family Foundation poll showed just 35 percent of Americans hold a favorable view of the law, right as the administration is planning to roll it out.” http://politico.pro/16jcEij\n2.) OBAMA: I NEED MORE \u0027FACTS\u0027 ON SYRIA.  During a press briefing today — his first in about two months —  President Barack Obama parried critics’ attacks about his slowed response to the revelation that Syria used chemical weapons. Specifically, he’s looking for evidence that the regime used chemical weapons on people. “What we now have is evidence that chemical weapons have been used inside of Syria, but we don’t know how they were used, when they were used, who used them,” he said this morning. “We don’t have a chain of custody that establishes what exactly happened.” POLITICO’s Jennifer Epstein has the readout for Pros: http://politi.co/17vwLYA\n3.) OBAMA TO REOPEN GITMO CLOSURE TALKS: We’ve heard it before, but Obama today vowed to reignite efforts to close Guantanamo Bay — about a half-decade after he first promised on the 2008 campaign trail to shutter the controversial prison for suspected terrorists. “I’m going to go back at this,” Obama said. “I’ve asked my team to review everything that’s been done on Guantanamo, everything we can do administratively, and re-engage with Congress to try to make the case that this is not something that’s in the best interests of the American people.”\n— Why now? Because 100 prisoners, many of whom have never been charged with any crimes, are on a hunger strike — forcing the Navy to fly several dozen nurses to the facility to tube feed them to keep them alive. “Guantanamo is not necessary to keep America safe,” Obama said. “It is expensive. It is inefficient. It hurts us in terms of our international standing. It lessens cooperation with our allies on counterterrorism efforts. It is a recruitment tool for extremists. It needs to be closed.”\nHUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS WANT ACTIONS, NOT WORDS. Amnesty International USA and the ACLU welcomed the president’s comments —  but words mean little to them. “The idea that [Obama’s] hands are tied [by Congress] is a myth,” Amnesty’s Michelle Ringuette told Pro Report. She says Obama could send home — or at least out of the remote prison — about half of the 160-plus detainees who have been cleared for transfer.  “If President Obama wants to close Guantanamo, he could start right now by appointing a high level [White House] position to oversee closure and move forward the process of the 86 detainees the U.S. has cleared for transfer, such as Shaker Aamer, who has been cleared to leave and who the UK government says should be free with his wife and children in London,” she said. The ACLU echoed those same demands in a statement. The State Department in January actually shuttered an office designated to overseeGuantanamo’s close.\nBREAKING ON PRO TODAY —\nRUMOR HAS IT: OBAMA EYEING NEW FCC CHAIR. President Barack Obama will nominate venture capitalist Tom Wheeler to be chairman of the FCC on Wednesday, a White House official told POLITICO. Brooks Boliek and Tony Romm introduce him: “Wheeler, 66, is a longtime Obama loyalist. During Obama’s first presidential campaign, Wheeler and his wife, Carol, spent six weeks in Iowa where they worked the phones and knocked on doors for the candidate. Wheeler also raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Obama’s two presidential campaigns.” http://politico.pro/10qsC1H\nCOMMUNITY BANKS\u0027 LOBBYISTS SPLIT ON \u0027TOO BIG TO FAIL.\u0027 Pro reporter Kate Davidson writes that “the Independent Community Bankers of America has come out swinging against Wall Street giants and last week endorsed a bill by Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and David Vitter (R-La.) that many in the industry say would force the biggest banks to shrink or break up. Meanwhile, the American Bankers Association, which counts banks of all sizes among its members, has urged caution arguing that efforts to crack down on the largest banks could hurt the entire industry. The split underscores the simmering tension between the two groups following enactment of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law as each seeks to be the go-to lobbying organization for community bankers.” http://politico.pro/18lqOMx\nAND HERE’S ANOTHER INDUSTRY SPLIT —\nBIOFUEL ALLIES AT ODDS. Darren Goode for Pros: “An effort by ethanol backers to get EPA to scale back the amount of advanced biofuels required in the U.S. gasoline supply this year has opened a rift in a decades-old friendship within the biofuels industry. The Renewable Fuels Association made the request to EPA in an attempt to limit imports of Brazilian-based sugarcane ethanol. But Michael McAdams, president of the Advanced Biofuels Association, sees RFA’s move as both encroaching on his turf and violating a pledge to protect the EPA-administered renewable fuels mandate at all costs.” http://politico.pro/11VzfvZ\nONLINE POKER: NEVADA HOLDS ALL THE CARDS. The first legal online poker website opened today, and Pro’s Steve Friess has the story: “Ultimate Gaming, a subsidiary of the Las Vegas-based company that owns the Ultimate Fighting Championship, went live Tuesday morning with the country’s first legal, regulated online poker betting site. Only players who are physically in Nevada can play on the site, UltimatePoker.com, per state law.” http://politico.pro/YkoM0a\nGOOD NEWS AT THE PUMP. If you fill your car up today, you’ll likely pay an average of $3.51 per gallon, but AAA this afternoon predicted that gas prices will fall to between $3.20 and $3.40 a gallon during this summer, our Darren Goode reports. “Families taking trips this summer can expect to pay lower gas prices than recent years as long as there are not any refinery problems or significant international news events,” AAA spokesman Avery Ash said in a statement. That’s atop more good news for this month: that gas prices have dropped to $3.55 per gallon in April — lower than the past two April averages. Ash says prices are down in part because of “ample refinery production and continued weak demands.”\n— Speaking of, here’s some good news for U.S. energy independence advocates: The U.S. Geological Survey today released findings estimating that oil reserves in North Dakota, South Dakota and Montana were about double what they thought in 2008, Pro’s Talia Buford writes. http://politico.pro/157HxXJ\nKERRY HEADED TO RUSSIA TO TALK SYRIA, IRAN, BOSTON BOMBINGS.

House prices in all 20 American cities monitored by the S\u0026P/Case-Shiller index increased for the second-straight month in February according to a report today. (Full report: http://bit.ly/11UrV3E ). Prices have recovered 9.3 percent since hitting rock bottom early last year. Jed Kolko, chief economist and vice president of Analytics at Trulia, tells Pro Report this is the biggest year-over-year increase since 2006 and monthly increase since 2005. “The price increases are largely a rebound from the very large decline we saw during the crash,” he said. He attributes the rise to investor activity, including the uptick in people buying low-priced homes to rent them out. Our financial services housing wonk Jon Prior writes that “the accelerating recovery adds another wrinkle to the housing policy debate in Washington, because it could take away some of the urgency to put new policies in place.”\n— What this means for buyers and sellers. Kolko unravels the report for us: “Rising prices are good for owners, but make it harder for renters to buy.” Homeowners “become wealthier and can take advantage of the gains if they decide to sell,” he explains. People are also less likely to default with home price increases because they have the option of selling for a profit if they’re unable to afford their current properties. But there’s a flipside to housing price increases when it comes to affordability. Housing prices have been low lately, a boon to those in the market to buy, but today’s news is “bad news if you want to buy but don’t own already,” he explains, i.e., bad news for renters looking to own. “With rising prices, affordability will start to become more of a concern” in some markets, he said.\nREID WANTS FAST FOXX FIX: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid praised Transportation secretary nominee Anthony Foxx in a statement this morning, saying he hopes the confirmation process “will be speedy given his impeccable credentials.”\nQUOTE OF THE DAY: “Maybe I should just pack up and go home.

About 250 protesters asked for their transfer to Sanaa, decrying conditions and treatment.\nSANAA, Yemen  â€” Activists and relatives of around 90 Yemeni detainees held in Guantanamo Bay protested outside the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa Monday to demand the prisoners\u0027 release after more than a decade in detention.\nYemenis make up the largest contingent of the 166 detainees held at the U.S. naval base in Cuba. Most were detained in Afghanistan following the 2001 U.S. invasion.\nRights activist and protester Abdel-Rahman Barman said that conditions at the prison are \"very poor\" and that at least two of the men there are on a  hunger strike .\nThey are among some 33 prisoners who the U.S. military says went on hunger strike, including three who were hospitalized for dehydration.\nThe prisoners say that they have been denied water and that the air conditioning was being kept frigid to punish them during a hunger strike. The military disputes the claims and says prisoners are also offered bottled water.\nThe largest of Guantanamo\u0027s hunger strikes began in the summer of 2005 and reached a peak of around 131 prisoners, when the facility held about 500 detainees. The U.S. military broke the protest by strapping detainees down and force-feeding them a liquid nutrient mix to prevent them from starving themselves to death.\nAn embassy employee was seen accepting a letter from relatives of the detainees who protested Monday.

It was prompted by what the prisoners considered more intrusive searches of their cells and of the Qurans that each man is issued by the government, as well as the more general complaint about their open-ended confinement without charge.\nSeven apparent suicides have taken place at the prison. The latest was a 32-year-old Yemeni in September who had been held there for around 10 years.

It’s the issue of periodic review of those who are held under the armed authorization of force directive. So, the issues are known; they are on the table. And if we areâ€”if we see hunger strike today, we interpret this as a symptom, as an indicator about the lack of perspective that those detainees have, the impression of not followâ€”of an American government which does not follow up on promises, promises that have been made for transfers.\nAMY GOODMAN: Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross.\nOn Thursday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said he backs President Obama’s call to close the military prison.\nOur next guest is Victoria Brittain, leading British writer who has closely covered GuantÃ¡namo for years. She co-wrote a memoir by former GuantÃ¡namo prisoner Moazzam Begg called Enemy Combatant. She co-authored the play Guantanamo: Honor Bound to Defend Freedom. And her new book is just out; it’s called Shadow Lives: The Forgotten Women of the War on Terror. Victoria Brittain also worked as associate foreign editor at The Guardian newspaper for 20 years.\nIt’s good to have you in our studios in New York on this side of the pond, Victoria.\nVICTORIA BRITTAIN: Thank you.\nAMY GOODMAN: What are these shadow lives? Describe who you have spent the last decade with.\nVICTORIA BRITTAIN: Well, some of the women that I’ve written about are the wives of GuantÃ¡namo prisoners. One, in particular, who is like chapter one of the book, is one of my closest friends, and I kind of lived alongside her and her children through a very long period when her husband was in GuantÃ¡namo, and she had absolutely no information about why he was there, when he might come back, no contact with him whatsoever.\nAnd a second woman, who I know very well, her husband is still in GuantÃ¡namo after 11 years. And he’s one of the 86 people who were cleared in that task force report that President Obama ordered very early on by very senior intelligence and military people. And those 86 people, which of course included a lot of Yemenis, but it also included this British resident, Shaker Aamer, whoâ€”having been cleared as innocent, everybody expected him to be released. The British government has also asked for him. But President Obama has not managed to release him.\nJUAN GONZÃ�LEZ: And do you know why?\nVICTORIA BRITTAIN: Well, there are many reasons. There are the roadblocks put up by Congress. There’s these rules that the secretary of state has to certify the person will never do a terrorist act. Our government has to certify, which they have said they were certainly prepared to do. And I think it’s important to remember that we’ve had 14 people come back to Britain from GuantÃ¡namo Bay, and never any one of them has done any tiny infraction of any sort. And, in fact, they have allâ€”including Shaker, who hasn’t come back, they have all had big payoffs from the British government, who didn’t want to be in court having to justify their complicity in rendition and torture of these men.\nSo, why don’t they want Shaker back? I mean, why don’t you people want to send Shaker back? One theory is that because he has been a leading figure in all the hunger strikes and a leading negotiator between the American authorities and the prisoners, he’s a person with tremendous personality and power. He was educated in the United States. He comes from Saudi Arabia. He lives in Britain and has a British family. So he covers all the bases.\nAMY GOODMAN: How was he taken to GuantÃ¡namo? Where was he picked up and when?\nVICTORIA BRITTAIN: He is one of the many people who were picked up as a response to the Americans dropping leaflets offering bounties for any foreigner that Pakistanis or Afghans turned over. So Shaker was sold to the Americans. He had been living in Afghanistan with his young family, like Moazzam Beggâ€”in fact, in the same house. And they had been building girls’ schools and digging wells. And it was as charity workers that they were there. And that’s completely uncontested by anybody. So, after being sold, he was then torturedâ€”\nAMY GOODMAN: Who was he sold by?\nVICTORIA BRITTAIN: He was sold by different groups. At that moment after the American bombing, there was a proliferation of different armed groups who picked up these different people as a money-making enterprise. And it’s not clear who sold him to who and how he ended up first in Kandahar, Bagram, and then in GuantÃ¡namo Bay.\nAMY GOODMAN: And in Kandahar, that was when?\nVICTORIA BRITTAIN: This was in 2002.\nAMY GOODMAN: So he’s been held for more than a decade.\nVICTORIA BRITTAIN: Yeah, he’s been held for 11 years, essentially.\nAMY GOODMAN: Can you read the letter he has gotten out? And how did he get this letter out?\nVICTORIA BRITTAIN: Well, this letter is particularly poignant now, when the hunger strike is going on, because he wrote this in a much earlier hunger strike and sent it to his wife, Zinnira, who’s chapter two of my book. And I always think of the impact of sitting in your very own living room with your little kids around you and receiving this letter from your husband. I’ll read the letter now:\n\"I am dying here every day, mentally and physically. This is happening to all of us. We have been ignored, locked up in the middle of the ocean for years. Rather than humiliate myself, having to beg for water, I would rather hurry up the process that is going to happen anyway. I would like to die quietly, by myself. I was once 250 pounds. I dropped to 150 pounds in the first hunger strike. I want to make it easy on everyone. I want no feeding, no forced tubes, no \u0027help\u0027, no \u0027intensive assisted feeding\u0027. This is my legal right. The British government refuses to help me. What is the point of my wife being British? I thought Britain stood for justice, but they abandoned us, people who have lived in Britain for years, and who have British wives and children. I hold the British government responsible for my death, as I do the Americans.\"\nNow, since then, the British have asked for him many times.\nAMY GOODMAN: That was 2006?\nVICTORIA BRITTAIN: This was 2006. But what Iâ€”one of the things I find so poignant about this letter and thinking about now, he thought then that he would be able to die. But because of the American medical personnel in GuantÃ¡namo Bay who force-feed people, this very painful process, through the nose, they are kept alive. So, I think the authorities’ preoccupation now is: Don’t let anybody die. And in Britain, of course, we have the experience of hunger strikers in Ireland whoâ€”we did not force-feed them, and Bobby Sands died. And this was a kind of political turning point. I think the Obama administration does not want that political turning point.\nBut judging by what the Red Cross is saying, he has had a team in there. He’s had doctors in there. He thinks that some of these people, who are of course very fragile after lots of hunger strikes, lots of torture and lots of beating up in this process they call \"earthing,\" when they enter a cell and throw the man to the groundâ€”and Shaker has had his back very seriously injured by this process on more than one occasion. So these people were in very poor shape when they made this dramatic decision to go on hunger strike.\nJUAN GONZÃ�LEZ: I’d like to ask you, theâ€”it was more than four years ago that President Obama, in his inaugural speech, announced that he was closing GuantÃ¡namo. We have the secretary of defense saying now he wants to close GuantÃ¡namo. And yet it remains open. And the impact on British law and on American law of this continued outpost of illegality and of torture existing as part of the war on terror?\nVICTORIA BRITTAIN: Well, in Britain, the feeling about American justice, as displayed in GuantÃ¡namo, is very, very strong. And I know from other former prisoners or families of former prisoners in places like Kuwaitâ€”or, indeed, there are still some Kuwaitis in thereâ€”everybody who’s been caught up in this, the reputation of American justice has had such a total body blow. And it gets worse every day. It’s really like a running sore.\nAMY GOODMAN: Last month, U.S. State Department official Michael Williams testified on GuantÃ¡namo at a hearing before the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights. The senior adviser for GuantÃ¡namo policy said the Obama administration is working within restrictions imposed by Congress to transfer prisoners out of the prison as part of an effort to close the facility, one of the president’s original campaign promises.\nMICHAEL WILLIAMS: The U.S. government continues to stand by its decisions to designate certain detainees for transfer subject to appropriate security measures. We have transferred 71 of those individuals, including the resettlement of 40 detainees in third countries in cases where the U.S. government identified humane treatment or related concerns in the individual’s country of origin. There are 56 individuals designated for transfer who remain at GuantÃ¡namo. Each potential transfer is individually assessed, as was the practice of the administration prior to the legislative restrictions, to examine whether appropriate security measures can be taken in the receiving country to mitigate the potential security threat the transferred individual may pose.\nAMY GOODMAN: Michael Williams also claimed during his testimony that GuantÃ¡namo prisoners do not face indefinite detention.\nMICHAEL WILLIAMS: The United States only detains individuals when that detention is lawful and does not intend to hold any individual longer than necessary. For instance, in 2010, following the application of the suspension of transfers to Yemen, the U.S. government did transfer a Yemeni detainee from GuantÃ¡namo to Yemen after he was ordered released by a U.S. federal court pursuant to his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The U.S. government is acutely aware that the majority of detainees at GuantÃ¡namo are Yemeni nationals, and recognizes the need to identify solutions for that population as part of our broader transfer efforts.\nAMY GOODMAN: That’s U.S. State Department official Michael Williams testifying on GuantÃ¡namo. Victoria Brittain?\nVICTORIA BRITTAIN: Well, I find it very hard to see how he can say, \"We don’t hold people indefinitely,\" when these people, likeâ€”I’ll take the example of Shaker and perhaps of another man, Fouzi Al Awda, a Kuwaiti man. These are people who have been held for 11 years. These are people who, everybody knows, pose no threat whatsoever. The Kuwaiti government has been asking for Fouzi forâ€”since the very, very beginning. The very first court case against President Bush and Donald Rumsfeld, Fouzi Al Awda was the correspondent. They cannot possibly say that the British government is not able to assure them that Shaker does not pose any threat of any sort. The British governmentâ€”William Hague, himself, the foreign secretary, has said it over and over again. So, I think there’s a bit of economical with the truth going on there.\nAMY GOODMAN: So, he’s on another hunger strike now. He was on, in 2006. Your book is about the families and the wives. Tell us about Zinnira and her family, her children. What effect does this have on the family, held forâ€”and I hesitate to use the wordâ€”the U.S. government uses \"detainee.\" For us in the United States, \"detainee\" means you’re detained for a small amount of time, as opposed to \"prisoner.\"\nVICTORIA BRITTAIN: We use \"prisoner.\" I think if you’ve been in a cage for 11 years, you’re a prisoner. Let’s be quite clear about that. I think the use of words, you know, can be very effective, and you do minimize it by saying \"detainee.\"\nWell, Zinnira. I want to tell you first, the first thing about Zinnira, and one of the bits in my book that I love most, is the poem love letter that she wrote to Shaker after 10 years, on Valentine’s Day. And that chapter is called \"He’s Still My Valentine.\" And for her, February the 14th is a special day. It’s not only the day that her youngest child was born, who Shaker has never seenâ€”that’s little Faris, who’s never seen his dadâ€”but it’s also the day, coincidentally, and she didn’t know it while she was giving birth, that Shaker was taken to GuantÃ¡namo. So, whenever this date comes around, it’s psychologically very stressful for her. But last year on this day, she wrote this amazing long poem called \"Heart of Gold.\" Andâ€”\nAMY GOODMAN: Can you read it?\nVICTORIA BRITTAIN: I can read a little bit of it. And I think it gives you an idea of the sweetness of the personality.\nYou are the roof over my head,\nYou are the shadow that can’t be lead,\nYou are my voice when the silence breaks,\nYour hand I seek, your hand I hold,\nCause you have a heart of gold.\nYou show me light in the dark,\nAnd you guide me when I am lost,\nYour happiness is all I ask,\nBut your story remains untold,\nCause you have a heart of gold.\nYou know, it’s a very hardâ€”sorry. But, you know, Zinnira, when she wrote that, she was in one of her up phases, and she was so pleased with the crafting of it, and she worked so hard on it to make it perfect to send to him. And she sends him photographs of the children and little stories and letters that the children write. But over these years, she has had some very serious breakdowns. And sometimes I’ve been with her when she’s been talking about wanting to go to paradise, because she has these bad dreams. Sometimes she dreams that Shaker’s dead. Sometimes she dreams that Shaker is divorcing her. And you have to reassure her over and over again, \"The voicesâ€”don’t listen to the voices. You have to push the voices away.\" And sometimes she can, and sometimes she can’t. And she’s had some sad periods in mental hospitals, and she has periods when she simply packs the kids into the car and goes off to stay with her aged parents, and they look after her until she recovers.\nAnd some of the time, you know, she’s a great mom. She runs her little house. She takes the kids to school. She does extra teaching after school. And she’s a wonderful, warm, outgoing mom, only concerned about her children. And always, always, when she talks about Shaker, it’s, you know, \"Will heâ€”will he think I’m a good wife?\" And sometimes she, in a good periodâ€”she’s been learning Arabic on the Internet, because she wants to make him proud of her in every possible way. And when his mother’s been ill in Saudi Arabia, she calls the mom and talks to her. And she asked me recently, you know, \"Do you think I should go to Saudi and pack up the children?\" She wasn’t in a very good phase. I said, \"No, you call your mother-in-law on the phone, and that’s the correct thing for a daughter-in-law. But your actual job is keeping your children and yourself ready for when Shaker comes back.\"\nAnd, you know, President Obama is the most powerful man in the world. Sorry about your Congress and all the roadblocks it put up. Is it really impossible that he could take this one case, which the British are begging him forâ€”the man was cleared by his own most senior peopleâ€”and say, \"Actually, we made a mistake with this one\"?\nJUAN GONZÃ�LEZ: Let me ask you, in terms of the families that you’ve dealt with, has there been any change whatsoever in terms of the government’s willingness to at least promote communication and contact or even visits on the part of the families to these prisoners while this indefinite detention is being resolved?\nVICTORIA BRITTAIN: No, no visits. There’s never been any visits. And the lawyers’ visits have recently become even more difficult. And now, not even journalists are allowed. I mean, they’re never allowed to speak to prisoners. But there have beenâ€”by great efforts of the Red Cross, there have been some efforts at Skype meetings. And Shaker has had a few talks on Skype with his family in Saudi and with his family in London, which was incredibly emotional when it first happened. But then the Skype failed. And there were two attempts when it didn’t work. And he then said, \"This is worse than not doing it.\" So although there have been a couple of sort of great moments when they saw dadâ€”and what the children told me was, you know, \"My dad, he’s so funny. He makes jokes all the time.\" And it was great for the kids and great for Zinnira to have those little moments. But real visit? And no real prospect. I mean, your officials say they’re not held indefinitely. But, you know, if it’s not indefinite, it’s definite. So, aren’t they going to say 11 years is enough?\nAMY GOODMAN: What is the justification, since the majority of these men have been cleared for release, the majority of the prisoners at GuantÃ¡namo, for not getting visits or for these kinds of calls or frequent visits from lawyers and journalists?\nVICTORIA BRITTAIN: Well, one of the first things that President Bush and his team did was to say, \"We don’t use the Geneva Conventions. They’re a quaint, World War II, European thing.\" And that took away from the prisoners the safeguards that were put in place by the world community after World War II. And they are one of the kind of pillars of our civilization. And to take those away at the stroke of a pen and with a scoffing phrase, I think was one of the deeply, deeply shocking things.\nAnd I’m sure the Red Cross has been agitating forâ€”well, for no torture, for a kickoff, and for much better facilities of all sorts for these men, and indeed for the release of the innocent ones. I mean, the fact that theâ€”that half of the 86 cleared men are Yemenis, who were ready to go back, and then after the Christmas Day underpants bombing, where the man was trained in Yemen, the president said, for the foreseeable future no one will go back to Yemen. Well, what’s the foreseeable future? That was quite a while ago, and no criteria. All we know is that Yemen has been, since then, enormously destabilized, in part by the drone assassinations, including of two American citizens. And all the assessments are that al-Qaeda is stronger in Yemen today than it was at the beginning, and that has been largely to do with American policy.\nAMY GOODMAN: Victoria Brittain, I want to thank you for being with us, journalist and author, associate foreign editor at The Guardian for 20 years, formerly served as adviser to UNIFEM on a report about the impact of war on women. She co-authored two plays about GuantÃ¡namo, and now her latest book, Shadow Lives: The Forgotten Women of the War on Terror. This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report.

Sydney, Australia - 08.10.09\nSlayer\u0027s Jeff Hanneman Dead At 49: Guitarist Dies of Liver Failure\nSlayer guitarist and songwriter Jeff Hanneman is dead at 49 after suffering liver failure. The revered musician died on Thursday (May 2, 2013) at the Hemet Valley Medical Center near his home in South California\u0027s Inland Empire area, according to Billboard.com. Slayer made the news public, announcing their devastation at the loss of their band-mate and brother. Tributes began pouring in immediately, with MEGADETH frontman Dave Mustaine tweeting, \"Tonight one less star will be shining and sadly, the stage got just a little bit darker. Jeff Hanneman 1964-2013.\"\n\"RIP TO A TITAN OF METAL,\" said Disturbed/Device frontman David Draiman, while drummer Mike Portnoy said, \"WOW...I\u0027m in shock...RIP Jeff Hanneman.\" The news hit the metal world harder given that most of the luminaries of the genre were attending the Annual Revolver Golden Gods Awards show at Club Nokia when news began filtering through. A spokesperson for \"Blood\" producer Rick Rubin told Billboard he was \"very sad\" and \"shocked\" by the death.\nIt had been a rough couple of years for Hanneman who ceased touring in early 2011 when he contracted necrotizing fasciitis, reportedly from a spider bite. The disease literally eats away at the flesh from deep layers of skin and tissues. Exodus musician Gary Holt stood in for Hanneman from 2011 while Pat O\u0027Brien joined later in the year. Throughout the ordeal, Hanneman\u0027s Slayer band-mates expressed optimism that he would one day return to the group full-time.\nSlayer has shifted 4.9 million albums since 1991, with the classics Reign of Blood, South Of Heaven and Seasons of the Abyss accounting for over 2 million of that tally. Tens of their records have charted on the Billboard 200, with 2006\u0027s Christ Illusion debuting at No.5.\nJeff Hanneman Was One Of The Best Loved Guitarists In The Metal World\nContactmusic\n","source":"google_52778141897737"}

The state is known for its recluse spider population. Seger, a medical doctor, is the medical director of Tennessee Poison Center and professor of medicine and emergency medicine at Vanderbilt.\nShe said that spider bites do not lead to organ failure. But infections -- which could develop after a variety of scenarios ranging from a mosquito bite or even a scratch on the skin from a nail -- can sometimes lead to bad outcomes. Could Hanneman have been suffering from an infection? And from what?\nWithout his treating physician weighing in, that is unclear.\nSeger stressed that, on the whole, patients with spider bites recover fine if they follow medical instructions and keep their bite areas clean so that a scab can form and fall off.\n\"I think it\u0027s really important that spider bites be understood because there\u0027s so many urban legends about, you know, you get a spider bite, your limb falls off and you die,\" Seger said. \"That doesn\u0027t happen.\"\nSeparate from discussion on the cause of death, the musician\u0027s passing reverberated throughout the music community.\nThe guitarist was with Slayer from its founding in 1981. Its breakthrough came five years later with the release of \"Reign in Blood,\" an album that included two songs -- \"Angel of Death\" and \"Raining Blood\" -- co-written by Hanneman.\nThat was one of 10 studio albums that the band put out over three decades together, during which they performed thousands of shows.\nOn Slayer\u0027s official website, Hanneman said that the last one -- \"World Painted Blood\" -- came together quickly because the band\u0027s members worked seamlessly.\n\"The interaction between all of us on this record was really something special,\" he said. \"... The chemistry was just good.\"\nIn 2006 and 2007, Slayer won Grammy awards for best metal performance.\nThe metal world -- in tweets from, among many others, the bands Rancid, Hatebreed, In Flames and Testament -- reacted to Hanneman\u0027s death with sadness and appreciation, referring to him as a \"true heavy metal legend\" and a \"brother in thrash.\"\n\"Jeff Hanneman will always be a metal god,\" wrote rocker Andrew WK. \"A true master, he gave energy and excitement to millions, and will continue to. #PartyForSlayer.\"\nCopyright 2013 by CNN NewSource .

He’d been writing songs with the band in anticipation of recording a new album later this year.\nBut in an unusual chain of events, a representative for the band said the bite may have contributed to Hanneman’s death more than two years later.\nHanneman died Thursday morning of liver failure at a Los Angeles hospital with his wife, Kathy, by his side, according to Slayer spokeswoman Heidi Robinson-Fitzgerald. He was 49.\nFamily members and doctors were not immediately available to discuss the cause of death.\nRobinson-Fitzgerald said Hanneman had been slowly recovering from necrotizing fasciitis, a flesh-eating disease that nearly cost him his arm. Such an infection can develop from a minor cut or scratch; Robinson-Fitzgerald blamed the spider bite, for which he failed to seek immediate treatment.\nInfections by flesh-eating bacteria are rare. The affliction can destroy muscle, fat and skin and may require surgery to remove the diseased tissue to save a patient’s life.\nHanneman had several operations to remove dead and dying tissue from his arm, the band said on its website last year.\nThe government estimates roughly 750 flesh-eating bacteria cases occur each year, usually caused by a type of strep germ. About 1 in 5 people with the most common kind of flesh-eating strep bacteria die.\nPeople with weakened immune systems can be more at risk.\nFlesh-eating bacteria, by itself, doesn’t cause liver failure. But at least one type of strep bacteria can cause streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, which can lead to liver failure.\nIt is unclear whether an autoposy will be scheduled. No funeral arrangements have been made.\n\"Jeff Hanneman will always be a metal god,\" rocker Andrew W.K. posted on Twitter.\nHanneman co-founded the thrash metal pioneers in Huntington Beach, Calif., in 1982.\n___\nAP Music Writer Chris Talbott contributed to this report from Nashville, Tenn., and Medical Writer Mike Stobbe contributed from New York.\n(Copyright 2013 by The Associated Press.

A window well protruded from the opposite corner. The basement space was otherwise vacant except for the pool of water surrounding an off-center floor drain.\nHaving recently endured a flooded basement myself, the sculpture struck a nerve.

The film received a mixed reception from critics. As of Friday, 49 percent of reviews recommended the movie on aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes.\nWarner Bros. believes “Jack” will perform well in overseas markets as it opens in more countries in the coming weeks. International sales, particularly for action movies, can run twice as high or more.\n“It was within the range of our expectations,” Jeff Goldstein, vice president theatrical distributions at Warner Bros., said about the film’s domestic weekend performance.\n“We know that this is a global picture and the technology and the special effects will really drive this movie internationally,” he added.\n“Jack the Giant Slayer” was produced by Time Warner Inc-owned Warner Brothers and Legendary Entertainment, which partnered with Warner on hits including “The Dark Knight” trilogy and “The Hangover” series.\nTwo of last year’s films with bigger budgets flopped – Walt Disney Co’s $250 million Mars epic “John Carter” and the $209 million action movie “Battleship” from Comcast Corp’s Universal Pictures – forcing the companies to acknowledge financial losses.\n“John Carter,” released in March last year, opened with $30.2 million, according to Box Office Mojo.\nJanney Montgomery Scott analyst Tony Wible, who compiles a database to project film performance, had estimated “Jack” would need to open with at least $25 million at U.S. and Canadian theaters to make back its budget, not including marketing costs.\n“21 and Over,” produced for $13 million, is a college party comedy about three friends who celebrate a 21st birthday on the night before a big exam. It was written by the screenwriters of “The Hangover.”\nThe “Last Exorcism” sequel follows the 2010 original about a minister who lets his demon-fighting be filmed by a documentary crew. In the new movie, the story resumes with the girl who was previously freed from an evil force running into more trouble. Distributor CBS Films, a unit of CBS Corp, acquired the sequel for about $3 million.\nRounding out the top five films was “Snitch,” which brought in $7.7 million.\nAnother new release, “Phantom,” failed to finish in the top 10 performing films. The movie stars Ed Harris and David Duchovny in the story of a Soviet submarine captain leading a secret mission.\n“Identity Thief” was released by Universal Pictures, a unit of Comcast. “Snitch” was distributed by Summit Entertainment, a unit of Lions Gate Entertainment “Phantom” was released by privately held RCR Distribution.\n","source":"google_52778141897737"}
