Please read our Legal Terms \u0026 Policies\nChildren\nA convicted American killer living in Cuba has become the first woman to be named on the FBIâ€™s â€œMost Wanted Terroristsâ€� list.\nIn 1979, Joanne Chesimard, a member of the Black Liberation Army (BLA), escaped from the US prison where she was serving a life sentence for the murder in 1973 of a New Jersey state trooper.\nThe FBI and state of New Jersey are offering a $2m (Â£1.3m) reward for information leading to her capture, which remains unlikely given the absence of a US extradition agreement with its communist neighbour. Up to 70 fugitives from the US are believed to be sheltered by the Cuban government. Chesimard, now 65, is no longer considered a threat, but is listed on the FBI site as a domestic terrorist, only the second US citizen to make the list.\nAlso known as Assata Shakur, Chesimard is aunt to the late hip-hop star Tupac Shakur. In 2000, another rapper, Common, released â€œA Song for Assataâ€� after meeting her in Havana; the song became controversial when Michelle Obama invited him to a White House event in 2011.\nIt not entirely clear why the FBI has added Chesimard to its â€œMost Wantedâ€� list now, besides its her crimeâ€™s 40th anniversary. The list does not necessarily reflect those who pose the most imminent threat to the US; rather it contains names to whom the FBI wishes to draw public attention, thus improving the chances of capture. Alleged paedophile Eric Toth, who replaced Osama bin Laden on the â€œ10 Most Wantedâ€� list, was last month recognised and arrested in Nicaragua.\nThe icy relations between US law enforcement and Cuba have thawed in recent years, with the government in Havana agreeing to deport a handful of fugitives. But Fidel Castro has personally championed Chesimard, making her extradition almost unthinkable; in 2005, Cubaâ€™s then-president declared, â€œThey wanted to portray her as a terrorist, something that was an injustice, a brutality, an infamous lie.â€�\nThe FBI, however, claims Chesimard continues to advocate â€œrevolution and terrorismâ€�. Mike Rinaldi of the FBIâ€™s Joint Terrorism Task Force insisted at a press conference: â€œThis case is just as important today as it was when it happened 40 years agoâ€¦ This is an active investigation and will continue as such until Chesimard is apprehended.â€�\nDuring the 1970s, the BLA was considered a revolutionary extremist organisation, responsible for the deaths of at least a dozen US police officers. In 1973 Chesimard was wanted for her involvement in crimes including bank robbery. Forty years ago this week, she and two associates were pulled over by a pair of state troopers on the New Jersey Turnpike for a broken tail light. They opened fire, wounding one officer, before Chesimard allegedly shot the second, Werner Foerster, at point blank range with his own service weapon, killing him â€œexecution-styleâ€�.\nIn 1977, she was given a life sentence for several crimes including first degree murder. â€œI donâ€™t even want to call it a trial, it was lynching, by an all-white jury,â€� Chesimard told the BET TV network in a rare 2001 interview. â€œI had nothing but contempt for the system of justice under which I was tried.â€� Two years into her sentence, armed BLA members broke Chesimard out of the Clinton Correctional Facility in New Jersey. She lived on the run until emerging in Cuba in 1984.\nFBIâ€™s Most Wanted Terrorist Hitlist\nHakimullah Mehsud\nWanted for alleged involvement in the suicide bombingÂ  of a US military base near Khost, Afghanistan, in 2009, whichÂ  killed seven Americans and injured six more.Â \nAbdullah Ahmed Abdullah\nWanted for alleged involvement in the 1998 bombings ofÂ  US embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya,Â  which killed hundreds.\nDaniel Andreas San Diego\nThe only other American citizenÂ  on the list.

Please read our Legal Terms \u0026 Policies\nChildren\nA convicted American killer living in Cuba has become the first woman to be named on the FBIâ€™s â€œMost Wanted Terroristsâ€� list.\nIn 1979, Joanne Chesimard, a member of the Black Liberation Army (BLA), escaped from the US prison where she was serving a life sentence for the murder in 1973 of a New Jersey state trooper.\nThe FBI and state of New Jersey are offering a $2m (Â£1.3m) reward for information leading to her capture, which remains unlikely given the absence of a US extradition agreement with its communist neighbour. Up to 70 fugitives from the US are believed to be sheltered by the Cuban government. Chesimard, now 65, is no longer considered a threat, but is listed on the FBI site as a domestic terrorist, only the second US citizen to make the list.\nAlso known as Assata Shakur, Chesimard is aunt to the late hip-hop star Tupac Shakur. In 2000, another rapper, Common, released â€œA Song for Assataâ€� after meeting her in Havana; the song became controversial when Michelle Obama invited him to a White House event in 2011.\nIt not entirely clear why the FBI has added Chesimard to its â€œMost Wantedâ€� list now, besides its her crimeâ€™s 40th anniversary. The list does not necessarily reflect those who pose the most imminent threat to the US; rather it contains names to whom the FBI wishes to draw public attention, thus improving the chances of capture. Alleged paedophile Eric Toth, who replaced Osama bin Laden on the â€œ10 Most Wantedâ€� list, was last month recognised and arrested in Nicaragua.\nThe icy relations between US law enforcement and Cuba have thawed in recent years, with the government in Havana agreeing to deport a handful of fugitives. But Fidel Castro has personally championed Chesimard, making her extradition almost unthinkable; in 2005, Cubaâ€™s then-president declared, â€œThey wanted to portray her as a terrorist, something that was an injustice, a brutality, an infamous lie.â€�\nThe FBI, however, claims Chesimard continues to advocate â€œrevolution and terrorismâ€�. Mike Rinaldi of the FBIâ€™s Joint Terrorism Task Force insisted at a press conference: â€œThis case is just as important today as it was when it happened 40 years agoâ€¦ This is an active investigation and will continue as such until Chesimard is apprehended.â€�\nDuring the 1970s, the BLA was considered a revolutionary extremist organisation, responsible for the deaths of at least a dozen US police officers. In 1973 Chesimard was wanted for her involvement in crimes including bank robbery. Forty years ago this week, she and two associates were pulled over by a pair of state troopers on the New Jersey Turnpike for a broken tail light. They opened fire, wounding one officer, before Chesimard allegedly shot the second, Werner Foerster, at point blank range with his own service weapon, killing him â€œexecution-styleâ€�.\nIn 1977, she was given a life sentence for several crimes including first degree murder. â€œI donâ€™t even want to call it a trial, it was lynching, by an all-white jury,â€� Chesimard told the BET TV network in a rare 2001 interview. â€œI had nothing but contempt for the system of justice under which I was tried.â€� Two years into her sentence, armed BLA members broke Chesimard out of the Clinton Correctional Facility in New Jersey. She lived on the run until emerging in Cuba in 1984.\nFBIâ€™s Most Wanted Terrorist Hitlist\nHakimullah Mehsud\nWanted for alleged involvement in the suicide bombingÂ  of a US military base near Khost, Afghanistan, in 2009, whichÂ  killed seven Americans and injured six more.Â \nAbdullah Ahmed Abdullah\nWanted for alleged involvement in the 1998 bombings ofÂ  US embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya,Â  which killed hundreds.\nDaniel Andreas San Diego\nThe only other American citizenÂ  on the list.

During the shootout, another officer was injured, a Black Panther member travelling with Shakur was killed, and Shakur was also shot. She was sentenced to life and was serving time when, in 1979, she escaped from the prison with the aid of other activists.\nAuthorities think Shakur has been living in Cuba since her escape and the FBI is offering a reward of up to $1 million for information that leads to her arrest. The state of New Jersey is adding a $1 million reward as well, bringing the total reward money to $2 million.\nShakur’s addition to the FBI list comes 40 years to the day of the 1973 shooting that led to her conviction. The timing is leading some to question why she appears on the list now. “If Black Panthers continue to be framed as dangerous, violent terrorists, the government’s role in the race war that birthed the panthers can be neatly tucked into history’s unread footnotes,” writes Natasha Lennard at Salon.com .\nHowever, Shakur’s freedom in Cuba, where she continues to speak out against the U.S. justice system, remains a sore spot for New Jersey police. “She continues to flaunt her freedom in the face of this horrific crime,” State Police Superintendent Col. Rick Fuentes said during a press conference Thursday .\n","source":"google_52778140979861"}

Joanne Chesimard was convicted of murdering New Jersey state trooper Werner Foerster in 1973, breaking out of prison in 1979 and has been on the run for more than three decades.\nThis week -- on the 40th anniversary of the killing -- the FBI added Chesimard, who is also the step-aunt and godmother to rapper Tupac Shakur, to its most wanted terrorist list and upped the reward for her capture to $2 million.\nAuthorities believed Chesimard escaped to Cuba and reportedly still lives and travels to countries friendly to the Cuban regime. She was considered to be the leader of the Black Liberation Army in the 1970s and now lives under the name Assata Shakur.\nCBS News\u0027 John Miller, who served as an assistant director at the FBI during Chesimard\u0027s time on the run, said she was \"the soul of the Black Liberation Army,\" in the \u002770s. The group planned assassinations of police officers in major American cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta and San Francisco. The anniversary of the \"shootout on the New Jersey Turnpike\" was the \"catalyst for doubling the reward\" for her capture on Thursday, Miller said.\nMiller described her \"incredibly daring\" 1979 prison escape, explaining that \"two men smuggled into the prison, took guards hostages and broke her out ... in 1984, they smuggled her to Mexico.\"\n\"Using a network of Cuban intelligence officers who worked with American radical groups, they got her into Cuba,\" Miller said, where she has lived out in the open and working as a teacher at Cuban universities until more recently when she went \"a little bit back underground.\"\nDespite the revival of attention on Chesimard this week, Miller said it is unlikely the FBI will be able to capture her in Cuba, a country that has historically been a welcoming hideout for U.S. fugitives. There are currently 70 American fugitives living in Cuba, according to Miller, and Chesimard has reportedly been provided with false papers by the Cuban government in order to travel in disguise to Mexico, Venezuela and several other countries.\nStill, it is in the interest of the U.S. to reiterate the importance of her capture because as \"we learned from the \u0027Arab Spring,\u0027\" Miller said, \"regime change can happen quickly,\" and the FBI wants to guarantee that if there is rapid change in Cuba, new leaders and authorities are aware that Chesimard is valuable to the U.S.\nWatch the complete discussion with John Miller about Joanne Chesimard in the player above\n© 2013 CBS Interactive Inc.

State Police reps\u0027 outrage over Common\u0027s invitation to White House\nWednesday, 11 May 2011 15:30\nBY ALICIA CRUZ\nNEWJERSEYNEWSROOM.COM\nUnion officials representing New Jersey State Police expressed outrage after learning of an invitation extended to entertainer, Common, from the White House for a celebration of American poetry and prose at the White House Wednesday evening.\nState Troopers Fraternal Association union president David Jones said that in addition to the \"deadly and dangerous\" message our youth are receiving from his lyrics, the fact that he pays homage to an accused cop killer in one of his songs is wrong.\nThe White House poetry event that Common , whose real name is Lonnie Corant Jaman Shuka Rashid Lynn, Jr., is set to attend comes during the same week when officers across the nation meet at the National Law Enforcement Memorial to honor their fallen comrades, NBC News reported .\nThe song in question is \"A Song for Assata,\" featured on Common\u0027s March 2000 album, \"Like Water for Chocolate.\"  The critically acclaimed album earned the singer his first gold record.\nThe song\u0027s lyrics suggest that Assata Shakur , the step-aunt of late rapper Tupac Shakur, was wrongfully convicted of the 1973 shooting on the New Jersey Turnpike, which left New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster and Black Liberation Army member Zayd Malik Shakur dead.\nDuring a 2005 interview with music website AllHipHop.com, Common explained his support of Shakur saying after he met the fugitive during a Black August trip to Cuba four years earlier he learned she was innocent. Common added that he “connected” to Shakur because of her passion and humanity and called her a “beautiful human being.”\nThe Black August hip-hop project began in 1998 at the request of political exiles Nahanda Abiodun and Assata Shakur, both in Cuba, as an event to raise awareness and financial support for political prisoners and their work, Lumumba Bandele told NewsOne.com.\nThe second goal of the project is to connect hip-hop communities internationally so artists travel to hip hop communities in Cuba, South Africa, Tanzania, and Brazil for cultural exchange, establishing networks that would enable their human rights movement to flourish all communities. According to Bandele, the project raised over $75,000 for political prisoner work in the U.S.\nLyrics sung by Common imply Shakur, formerly Joanne Chesimard, was abused while in prison and speak about her daring 1979 escape from New Jersey’s Clinton Correctional Facility (now the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility) in Union Township. Shakur fled to Cuba after the prison escape where she has lived in political asylum. The lyrics are:\nIn the Spirit of the Black Panthers.\nIn the Spirit of Assata Shakur.\nWe make this movement towards freedom\nPolice questioned but shot before she answered\nOne Panther lost his life, the other ran for his\nScandalous the police were as they kicked and beat her\nAssata had been convicted of a murder she couldna done\nMedical evidence shown she couldna shot the gun\nShe untangled the chains and escaped the pain\nHow she broke out of prison I could never explain\nAnd even to this day they try to get to her\nbut she\u0027s free with political asylum in Cuba.\nMore than 30 years after the murder of fellow Trooper Foerster, 34, a husband, father and Vietnam veteran from Old Bridge, the anger felt by the slain trooper’s colleagues has not dissipated. Several speak openly about their feelings and desire to see Shakur brought to justice.\nRetired State Police troop commander, Sal Maggio, said he hopes she will be captured someday, but attempts to have her extradited back to the U.S. from Cuba remain unsuccessful. On the 32nd anniversary of the Turnpike shootings, the FBI declared Shakur a \"domestic terrorist\", and announced the bounty for capture at $1 million, the largest amount placed on a fugitive in the history of New Jersey.\nShakur, who New Jersey State Police superintendent Rick Fuentes referred to as \"120 pounds of money,\" remains at the top of the State police most-wanted list, with a $100,000 reward for her capture. Her co-conspirator, Clark Squire, now known as Sundiata Acoli, is serving a life sentence for his part in the murder at the Otisville Federal Penitentiary in New York. New Jersey State Police spearheaded a frenetic letter-writing campaign that led to the State Parole Board denying the 67-year-old former NASA Engineer\u0027s release in 1993 and 2010.\nSquire, according to a 2010 New York Daily News article, accepted responsibility and expressed regret for the death of Trooper Foerster during his parole hearing, although he continued to deny that he shot him, AfroCuba.com reported .\nJones and Maggio told NBC News they do not believe the Obama’s are aware of Common\u0027s song about Shakur. Maggio added that he liked the President and First Lady and thinks Obama has been doing a \"pretty good job lately.\"\nWhile the 39-year-old entertainer has never been considered a thug or contentious rapper, media outlets, along with Sarah Palin have denounced the First Lady\u0027s invite after the Daily Caller published the libretto that allegedly criticizes former President George W. Bush, CBS News reported .  Lawmen seem to take Common’s open support of Shakur and Michelle Obama’s invite as a slap in the face.\nNew Jersey State Sen. Anthony Bucco (R-Morris) called on Obama to apologize to the State Police for inviting Common.\n“President Obama must apologize to the New Jersey State Police for inviting a rap singer who praises the assassin of a New Jersey State Trooper to the White House,” Bucco said. “The president should realize, especially after May 1, the sacrifices of our brave men and women in uniform who protect us all, both at home and abroad. I am especially outraged that the rapper finds the controversy over his lyrics amusing. The murder of a trooper is not a laughing matter.”\nFrom his tweets and retweets of various news articles, including one report by FOX News, which called him a \"vile rapper,\" Common seems to find the hoopla over his appearance at the White House amusing. He tweeted , \"So apparently Sarah Palin and Fox News doesn\u0027t like me.\" In one reply on his Twitter page, Common sarcastically tweeted, “It\u0027s not funny JP. I\u0027m dangerous!”\nFans of the rapper found Fox News\u0027 \"vile\" comment hypocritical after MediaMatters.Org pointed out that a Fox News reporter praised the rappers lyrics last year saying Common\u0027s music was \"very positive.\" Other celebrities scheduled to appear at the White House poetry event include Elizabeth Alexander, Billy Collins, Rita Dove, Kenneth Goldsmith, Alison Knowles, Aimee Mann and Jill Scott.\n","source":"google_52778140979861"}

Davis escaped, and with the help of family and friends, eluded capture for 17 days despite a massive manhunt, which finally ended with him surrendering to police only when assured by the presence of local reporters that he would not be harmed. In the subsequent trial, the prosecution contended Davis was a drug dealer who specialized in armed robbery and homicides.  The defense team, led by renowned attorney William Kunstler, contended that Davis had been recruited into dealing drugs by crooked cops and the real object of the raid was to silence him by murder.  When an all-minority jury acquitted Davis for acting in self-defense, 1500 police officers publicly protested against the verdict.  Several subsequent trials resulted in several more acquittals on murder charges, until 1989 when Davis and his brother were convicted for the killing of drug dealer Raymond Vizcaino.  After nearly 20 years in prison, and just a few days after agreeing to an exclusive interview with AMERICAN GANGSTER, Davis was murdered by a fellow convict.     -- \"MONSTER\" KODY / October 30, 2008     Few gangsters emblemize the tragedy of gang life and the failed promise of so many who follow the path than \"Monster\" Kody Scott, best-selling author and career criminal.  A legend in south central Los Angeles for his fearsome devotion to gang violence, Scott became a subject of mainstream fascination after the 1992 riots in LA cast a national spotlight on the conditions that led to that uprising.   The publication of his gang memoir Monster written while in prison was once a frightening journey through his past and a tantalizing harbinger of his possible redemption.     -- MIDGET MOLLEY / TBD     The son of a minister, this former drug lord of Atlantic City was once said to have earned over a million dollars a month, a position he flaunted in public by literally wearing a gold crown on his head.  Busted in 1989, he spent nearly 20 years in prison, during which time his oldest son was killed on the streets.  Deeply chastened by that experience, Molley renounced his former trade, and now toils as a high-profile advocate for the rights of fellow Muslims in prisons, whom he believes are routinely oppressed for their beliefs in the wake of 9/11.     -- CORNELL JONES / TBD     D.C. drug kingpin Rayful Edmond\u0027s predecessor, Cornell Jones was a native son who quietly plied his trade in the shadow of the Capitol, and ultimately developed a network that funneled drugs throughout the major cities of the Eastern seaboard and even throughout Europe.  Jones claims \"credit\" for the accidental invention of an aphrodisiacal mix of pot and PCP that was loosely known on the street as \"love boat,\" and turned D.C. into a Mecca for \"angel dust.\"  For years Jones stayed under the radar of law enforcement by developing a business model that emphasized harmony over violence, while keeping a low personal profile and funneling his own profits into legitimate businesses.  He did it so well that his arrest and incarceration in 1985 created a huge vacuum in the D.C. drug trade, leading to unprecedented murder rates.  Since Jones\u0027 release from prison, he runs a non-profit organization to help inmates prepare for life after prison.     -- J. EDGAR HOOVER \u0026 COINTELPRO / TBD     The first and most famous director of the FBI consolidated his power through a combination of brilliant public relations moves and compromising personal files he kept on politicians who held his fate in their hands. Positioned as an avowed and implacable enemy of Communism, Hoover was often at odds with left-leaning Black leaders throughout his reign, including Marcus Garvey and Paul Robeson.   During the tumultuous \u002760s decade, Hoover went further, undertaking a virtual counter-revolution against the civil rights movement -- with particular venom directed at Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. -- and ultimately enabling the Bureau to employ blackmail, smear campaigns, \"dirty tricks,\" and even armed attacks on several leaders. The most notorious bureau program was the Counter Intelligence Program, or COINTELPRO, which was formed to investigate and undermine \"subversive\" organizations that were almost invariably aligned with the movement for civil rights. More than a decade later, U.S. congressional investigations would detail the scope of COINTELPRO\u0027s actions, which implicated the bureau in the framing and even murder of several prominent activists.     -- MUTULU SHAKUR / TBD     Mutulu Shakur, Tupac Shakur\u0027s step-father and the father of rapper Mopreme, has spent the past quarter century in federal prison, thanks in part to his conviction for helping to plan and execute the $1.6 million robbery of a Brinks armored truck in New York in 1982 that left three people dead.  In addition to the robbery, Mutulu was later accused of helping his sister Assata Shakur escape from prison, enabling her to flee to Cuba where she lives today. Despite incarceration in federal prison, Shakur has retained strong ties to contemporary politics and culture, and teamed with his late son Tupac to write a \"thug life handbook,\" with a message against violence and drugs.     -- GUY FISHER / TBD     The first Black owner of the Apollo Theater in Harlem was a dashing ladies\u0027 man, sports fan, bon vivant -- and drug lord. Growing up in the rough and tumble Patterson projects of the South Bronx, Fisher became the youngest and most flamboyant member of \"the council,\" a consortium of top drug dealers in Harlem in the 1970s headed by Nicky Barnes. Both friends and foes paid tribute to Fisher\u0027s sharp intelligence and organizational skills, which kept \"the council\" going long after Barnes\u0027 own conviction and life sentence for trafficking in 1977.   In the early \u002780s, Barnes turned state\u0027s witness against his former allies, claiming he was motivated by Fisher\u0027s romantic alliance with his favorite mistress.  Convicted for trafficking and sent to prison for life, Fisher embarked on a remarkable transformation, writing novels, counseling inmates to avoid a criminal life, and earning several academic degrees, including a doctorate in sociology -- all the while keeping his own counsel from mainstream media. Now for the first time, Fisher, his family members, friends and associates tell their side of the story to AMERICAN GANGSTER.     -- THE SHOWER POSSE / TBD     An incredibly violent gang with operations in the 1980s that stretched from Jamaica to New York to Miami and beyond, the Shower Posse got their name thanks to their frequent skewering of victims with rounds of automatic weapons fire.  From their beginnings in the ghettos of Kingston Jamaica, the Shower Posse and their main posse rivals, the Spanglers, came to prominence as the muscle behind Jamaica\u0027s two political parties.  Their ongoing battle culminated in the bloody election campaign of 1980, which resulted in an influx of arms to the island and the election of Shower-backed candidate Edward Seaga.  The Shower Posse\u0027s acknowledged leader during this era, Vivian Blake, helps AMERICAN GANGSTER tell the story of their rise and fall.     -- WILLIE LLOYD / TBD Willie Lloyd grew up in Lawndale, Chicago; he came to prominence in the late \u002760s and was known for his ruthless demeanor and willingness to back it up.   He was sent to prison in 1971 for the murder of an Iowa police officer, where his influence grew enormously. He was ordained the Lords \u0027official spokesperson\u0027 and eventually grew to become its \u0027king of kings\u0027 over the several vice-lords divisions.  After his release from prison in the early \u002790s, Lloyd took over operations on the streets again -- until he went back to prison again on weapons charges.  In jail, he experienced an epiphany about gang life and its consequences.  Released in 2001, he publicly retired from the gang he\u0027d led for decades and embarked on a crusade to turn kids away from the life -- forming an organization called \"the cease fire project\" and even lecturing at prestigious universities like DePaul.  In 2003, Lloyd was shot on the street by gang members unhappy with his turnabout, an assassination attempt that has left him paralyzed from the neck down. Undeterred, he remains an articulate spokesman for \"cease-fire\" and related anti-gang efforts.     -- THE ROMPER ROOM GANG / TBD     The Romper Room Gang was a group of notorious home grown bank robbers from the troubled Bay Area suburb of Vallejo.  They robbed dozens of banks in the mid \u002790s, and had a healthy following, including rapper Mac Dre -- himself convicted of conspiracy to rob.  After serving his time, Dre emerged as a major underground figure in the Bay Area hip-hop scene and nurtured the careers of several other Romper Room robbers-turned-rappers as well.  Mac and his cohorts also developed a big following in Kansas City -- where, tragically, he was murdered after a concert in 2004, allegedly by a Kansas City rapper he worked with named \"Fat Tone\" Watkins.   This incident resulted in a revenge killing of Fat Tone in Las Vegas.  Since his death, Mac Dre has become an icon in the Bay area, and especially in Vallejo, where violent crime remains out of proportion to its size and locale, and recently made headlines as the first city in California history to declare bankruptcy.  Dre\u0027s legacy is carried on there by former friends and partners in crime who are now blazing new paths as artists and businessmen, though still shadowed by their pasts.

We\u0027re still moving this and other older stories into our new format. In the meanwhile, click here to go to the current home page.\nThe governator\u0027s hit list\nJanuary 13, 2006 | Pages 6 and 7\nALAN MAASS and JOE ALLEN look at the men and women whose legacy of resistance against racism Arnold Schwarzenegger smeared.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\"The dedication of Williams\u0027 book \u0027Life in Prison\u0027 casts significant doubt on his personal redemption...Specifically, the book is dedicated to \u0027Nelson Mandela, Angela Davis, Malcolm X, Assata Shakur, Geronimo Ji Jaga Pratt, Ramona Africa, John Africa, Leonard Peltier, Dhoruba Al-Mujahid, George Jackson, Mumia Abu-Jamal, and the countless other men, women, and youths who have to endure the hellish oppression of living behind bars.\u0027 The mix of individuals on this list is curious. Most have violent pasts, and some have been convicted of committing heinous murders, including the killing of law enforcement.\"\nSO READS the statement of California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in denying clemency for Stan Tookie Williams. Twelve hours after the statement was issued, Stan was brought into the execution chamber at San Quentin Prison, and the former gang leader-turned-internationally renown peacemaker was put to death.\nSchwarzenegger claimed the dedication of Stan\u0027s Life in Prison autobiography showed that his record of turning his life around was a fraud.\nBut the men and women on Stan\u0027s list aren\u0027t \"criminals.\" They are revolutionaries--African Americans and Native Americans who were subjected to the dehumanizing conditions of U.S. prisons, but who refused to submit, and dedicated their lives to the struggle against racism and oppression.\nBy singling out this dedication, Schwarzenegger and his aides showed that Stan Tookie Williams died most of all because of the political challenge he represented to the status quo of racism and repression in the U.S. today.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nSTAN\u0027S SUPPORTERS continued to hold out hope that Schwarzenegger would grant clemency even as the December 13 execution date approached. During his two years in office, Schwarzenegger had seemed less hard-line on law-and-order issues than his predecessor, Democrat Grey Davis, and the governor claimed to reporters that he was struggling over the decision.\nBut the statement released by Schwarzenegger to justify denying clemency proved that he never had any intention of stopping the execution. As University of Southern California law professor Jody Armour told a reporter, \"There is nothing in the tone of the governor\u0027s decision that suggests it was a close call or agonized over.\"\nThe statement condemns Stan for refusing to admit to his role in the four murders he was convicted of.\nBut Stan always proclaimed his innocence in these cases. In demanding that Stan do \"the one thing Williams will not do\" and confess, Schwarzenegger and his aides ignored the strong evidence that Stan was wrongfully convicted--and the climate of racist hysteria that accompanied his original trial, in which the prosecutor compared Stan in the courtroom to a \"Bengel tiger\" caged at the zoo.\nAs for Stan\u0027s decade-long campaign to warn young people against gangs, crime and prisons, the statement dismissed them out of hand. \"[T]he continued pervasiveness of gang violence leads one to question the efficacy of Williams\u0027 message,\" it smugly concluded--effectively holding Stan responsible for all gang-related crime.\nBut the most despicable passage in the statement came at the end, when it smeared the revolutionaries to whom Stan dedicated his autobiography.\n\"[I]t seems to me that we saw a very intentional politicization of this process, namely the equation of what Schwarzenegger would call lawlessness and criminality with radical political activism,\" said Angela Davis when asked about being singled out in the statement. \"It is revealing, it seems to me, that every single name he evoked by quoting the dedication from Tookie\u0027s autobiography--every single name is the name of a person of color, a black person or a Native person.\"\nBefitting the California setting, the statement gives special treatment to George Jackson, a former California prisoner who became a leader of the Black liberation struggle while incarcerated in San Quentin, and who was gunned down by prison guards in 1971. In a further passage and a footnote, the statement shamelessly repeats the discredited pack of lies--a wild story about an escape attempt and a handgun concealed in Jackson\u0027s hair--told by San Quentin officials to justify the assassination.\nThe venom of this and other parts of the Schwarzenegger statement is worthy of the most right wing of Republican prosecutors, or maybe the head of the politically influential prison guards\u0027 union--someone still angry that George Jackson\u0027s book Soledad Brother became a best seller.\nBut that\u0027s not who wrote it. According to the Los Angeles Times, \"the statement was largely drafted by Andrea Hoch, Schwarzenegger\u0027s legal affairs secretary, and her predecessor, Peter Siggins.\"\nBefore working for Schwarzenegger, both Hoch and Siggins served as top deputies in the attorney general\u0027s office under Democrat Bill Lockyer. Their role in authoring the governator\u0027s political hit job underlines how little difference there is in either wing of the California political establishment over the crimes of the racist injustice system.\nBut for the thousands of people who took action to stop Stan\u0027s execution, we will remember the struggle against racism and oppression that Stan--and the revolutionaries he dedicated his autobiography to--stood for.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nNelson Mandela\nNelson Mandela was the best-known leader of the struggle to overturn South Africa\u0027s racist apartheid system--under which a small white minority held power and denied all rights to the Black majority.\nMandela became politically active as a student, joining the African National Congress (ANC) in 1942 and co-founding its youth organization in 1944. The ANC\u0027s nonviolent campaigns of the 1950s had mass support, but were brutally suppressed. Mandela led the organization in adopting a strategy of armed struggle. He was arrested in 1962, and spent almost three decades behind bars in the notorious Robbin Island prison.\nMandela and the ANC were denounced as \"terrorists\" not only by the regime, but by the U.S. government and multinational corporations that wanted to do business in South Africa. But an international solidarity campaign exposed the truth about apartheid, and Mandela became a hero around the world.\nWith the struggle--led increasingly by Black workers--growing ever more powerful, Mandela was released in 1990, and the ban on the ANC was lifted. Following negotiations led by Mandela, the ANC won the country\u0027s first democratic elections in 1994, and Mandela became president.\nThough the new government\u0027s policies frustrated the hopes of most Blacks that the ANC would bring material improvements in their lives, Mandela remains an internationally known symbol of resistance to tyranny.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nAngela Davis\nAngela Davis grew up in the segregated South, attending Black-only schools until she was accepted into an American Friends Service Committee program that brought her north to attend high school in New York City. Her further studies took her to Brandeis University in Boston, and later to the Sorbonne in Paris and the University of Frankfurt in Germany.\nReturning to the U.S., Davis immersed herself in the Black liberation and women\u0027s liberation struggles. In 1969, then-California Gov. Ronald Reagan fired Davis from her job as a lecturer at the University of California-Los Angeles because of her membership in the Communist Party. Following an outburst of opposition, she was later rehired.\nThe next year, Davis was charged with conspiracy and murder for her supposed participation in a plan to help radical Black prisoner George Jackson escape. After 18 months behind bars, Davis was acquitted of all charges.\nDavis has continued a life of activism since, especially as an outspoken opponent of what she calls the \"prison-industrial complex.\" She was active in the campaign to save Stan Tookie Williams and was one of the speakers at the huge rally outside San Quentin Prison on the night of Stan\u0027s state-sponsored killing.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nMalcolm X\nMalcolm X was born Malcolm Little in 1925. He endured a childhood of racist violence that claimed his father\u0027s life and made his mother mentally ill. After moving from Michigan to New York and later Boston, he was arrested and sent to prison for burglary in 1946.\nWhile behind bars, he converted to the Nation of Islam, and began using \"X\" to stand in for a name that was stolen during slavery. A brilliant speaker and debater, after his release, Malcolm became the Nation\u0027s most effective organizer and spokesperson.\nWith the civil rights movement in motion in the South, Malcolm came to represent the more militant face of Black anger at racism in the U.S. He was harshly critical of movement leaders for insisting on nonviolent civil obedience and limiting the struggle to Southern voting rights. His outspoken support of the right of self-defense against racist attacks won growing support among the new generation of young civil rights activists.\nIn late 1963, following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, tensions within the Nation came to a head, leading Malcolm to break politically. Following a trip to Africa and the Middle East, Malcolm concluded that the Black struggle in the U.S. was bound up with anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles around the world. He formed a new organization independent of the Nation and began building ties with other activists.\nOn February 21, 1965, he was assassinated during a speech in Harlem in a plot that is thought to have involved the FBI. But his influence was deeply felt in the Black Power movement to come, and continues to be to this day.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nAssata Shakur\nAssata Shakur was one of many revolutionaries in the U.S. driven into exile in the 1960s and \u002770s. She has been living in Cuba since 1984 and is also the godmother of the late Tupac Shakur.\nDuring the 1960s, Assata participated in the Black liberation movement, the student movement and the struggle against the Vietnam War. She became a member of the Black Panther Party in New Jersey.\nOn May 2, 1973, Assata and fellow Panther members were pulled over by the New Jersey state police. An unarmed Assata was shot twice--and then charged with murder of a white police officer. She was convicted by an all-white jury and sentenced to life plus 33 years in prison. She spent six-and-a-half years behind bars before escaping from the Clinton Correctional Facitlity for Women in 1979.\n\"[F]earing that I would be murdered in prison, and knowing that I would never receive any justice, I was liberated from prison, aided by committed comrades who understood the depths of the injustices in my case, and who were also extremely fearful for my life,\" she said.\nThe federal government continues to pursue Assata. Last May, Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez authorized a $1 million bounty \"for information leading to the return\" of Assata Shakur.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nGeronimo ji Jaga Pratt\nGeronimo ji Jaga Pratt was a decorated Vietnam veteran and prominent member of the Black Panther Party in California in the late 1960s. He would spend 27 years in prison for a crime he didn\u0027t commit--one of the highest-profile victims of the FBI\u0027s COINTELPRO operation.\nAfter serving in Vietnam, Geronimo relocated from Louisiana to Los Angeles, where his enormous talents as a political organizer were quickly recognized. He became a leader of the Panthers in LA after the FBI-sponsored murder of Bunchy Carter and John Huggins in the fall of 1969.\nSoon after, the FBI targeted Geronimo for \"neutralization.\" In 1970, he was charged with the murder of a Santa Monica schoolteacher, Caroline Olsen. From the start, Geronimo maintained his innocence, saying that he was in San Francisco attending a national meeting of the Panthers at the time that Olsen was killed.\nThe FBI could have proved that Geronimo was in San Francisco at the time of the murder because it was monitoring phone calls at the Panthers\u0027 headquarters in Oakland. But this information was suppressed. The chief witness at Geronimo\u0027s trial was a paid informant of the FBI, Los Angeles police and the LA District Attorney\u0027s office.\nGeronimo was falsely convicted and sentenced to life in prison. Amnesty International designated him \"a prisoner of conscience,\" and many well-known people, including his lawyer, the late Johnny Cochrane, campaigned for his release. He was turned down for parole 16 times.\nGeronimo\u0027s conviction was overturned in 1997, and he was finally released from prison.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nJohn Africa\nJohn Africa, born Vincent Leaphart, co-founded the radical, mainly Black organization MOVE in Philadelphia in 1972. The group immediately faced harassment from police and city officials.\nIn 1978, Philadelphia Mayor Frank \"Super-cop\" Rizzo ordered a blockade of MOVE\u0027s headquarters in a West Philadelphia neighborhood. An attempt to force out those occupying the building preceded a \"shootout\" in which MOVE members say they didn\u0027t fire a shot. One officer was fatally wounded, almost certainly by a police bullet, but 10 members of the MOVE group were convicted of his murder.\nLater, John Africa helped establish a new MOVE headquarters on Osage Avenue in Philadelphia. On May 13, 1985, police--allegedly responding to complaints from neighbors--surrounded the new MOVE home.\nDuring the siege, a police helicopter dropped an explosive charge on the roof of the building, causing a fire that leveled the surrounding city block, destroying a total of 62 homes. John Africa was one of the 11 victims--five of them children--of the explosion and resulting fire.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nRamona Africa\nRamona Africa was the only adult in the MOVE building to survive the police bombing in May 1985. Yet she, not the cops, was arrested on riot and conspiracy charges, and sent to jail for seven years.\nOn her release, her civil lawsuit pinned the blame for the bombing on city officials. Since then, Ramona Africa has continued the struggle to win freedom for MOVE members--and is a leader in the campaign in support of journalist and MOVE supporter Mumia Abu-Jamal, who was framed and sent to death row after helping to expose the truth about the first siege of the MOVE home in 1978.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nLeonard Peltier\nLeonard Peltier is one of America\u0027s longest-serving political prisoners. He has spent almost half his life--some 30 years--in prison for a crime he didn\u0027t commit: the murder of two of FBI agents on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota in June 1975.\nPeltier was an active member of the American Indian Movement (AIM) in the late 1960s and \u002770s. AIM was subject to vicious government persecution. From 1973 to 1976, during the FBI\u0027s \"reign of terror\" on the Pine Ridge reservation, more 60 AIM members and supporters were killed. Across the country, AIM leaders were murdered or jailed on trumped-up charges.\nOn February 6, 1976, Peltier was extradited from Canada to the U.S. based on coerced and fraudulent testimony. Federal prosecutors presented similar testimony during his subsequent trial in 1977--while suppressing evidence beneficial to Peltier. Years later, Peltier\u0027s supporters learned through the Freedom of Information Act that a critical ballistics test on the rifle Peltier supposedly used was negative. As Lynn Crooks, the lead prosecutor in the Peltier, later admitted: \"We can\u0027t prove who shot those agents.\"\nIn 2000, at the end of the Clinton administration, Amnesty International called on the president \"to free a prisoner whose guilt has long been in question.\" But as in past such efforts, FBI personnel mobilized a bitter opposition, and Clinton did nothing.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nDhoruba Bin Wahad\nDhoruba al-Mujahid Bin Wahad is the adopted name of Richard Moore. He joined the Black Panther Party in New York in 1968.\nBin Wahad was first arrested in 1969 as part of the Panther 21 conspiracy case, in which leaders of the group were charged in a conspiracy to blow up New York City department stores, subway stations and police stations. This nakedly political trial was an effort to destroy the East Coast leadership of the Black Panther Party.\nBut on May 13, 1971, after the longest political trial in state history, all 21 Panthers were acquitted of all charges after the jury deliberated for just 45 minutes.\nWhile free on bail before the trial, Bin Wahad had fled to Algeria, but he returned to the U.S. following the acquittal. Shortly afterward, he was charged in the deaths of several police officers in New York. It took three trials to convict him, and he was sentenced to 25 years to life.\nIn 1988, Bin Wahad appealed his conviction, based on uncovered FBI COINTELPRO documents revealing the prosecutors\u0027 suppression of evidence beneficial to the defense. His conviction was overturned in March 1990.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nGeorge Jackson\nGeorge Jackson was one of the most prominent figures of the radical movement of the 1960s, and his prison writings, published in a book called Soledad Brother, touched the lives of millions when they came out in the early 1970s. But since his assassination in 1971, he has been almost forgotten by the general public.\nJackson was sentenced to prison in 1958 for his part in a $70 gas station robbery. He was given a 1-year-to-life sentence under California\u0027s then \"indeterminate\" sentencing guidelines--which meant that he had no fixed sentence and was at the mercy of prison officials, who could keep extending his jail term if they chose to.\nWhile Jackson was in prison, the civil rights and Black Power movements were sweeping the country. They had a huge impact on him, and he turned his life around. Jackson read voraciously and became an outspoken activist and writer. The Black Panther Party was so impressed by Jackson that it gave him the rank of field marshal.\nAfter Jackson and two other inmates were charged with the murder of a prison guard in 1970, support committees sprang up across the country. Before he could stand trial, Jackson was killed by San Quentin prison guards on August 21, 1971--allegedly because he was trying to escape.\nPrison officials spun a fantastical story claiming that Jackson\u0027s lawyer, Stephen Bingham, smuggled a gun into San Quentin--past an array of metal detectors--and handed it to Jackson, who then hid it in his Afro before the shooting began. Bingham fled the country following Jackson\u0027s assassination. He returned to the U.S. in 1984, and in 1986, he was tried and acquitted of all charges related to the alleged \"escape attempt.\"\nThere can be little doubt that George Jackson was targeted by the authorities because of his prominence as an articulate Black revolutionary, speaking out from within prison walls.\nHis assassination has never been seriously investigated, but Jackson\u0027s writings remain a powerful indictment of racism in the criminal justice system and U.S. society at large--which is undoubtedly why Schwarzenegger singled him out for special attention.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nMumia Abu-Jamal\nMumia Abu-Jamal became probably the best-known death row political prisoner in the U.S.\nGrowing up in Philadelphia, Mumia joined the Black Panthers as a teenager, becoming Minister for Information of the Philadelphia chapter. During the 1970s, he turned to broadcasting and became one of the top names in local radio. His journalism helped to expose police misconduct and brutality, earning him the lasting hatred of the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP).\nOn December 9, 1981, while he was driving a cab, Mumia saw his brother being beaten by police officer Daniel Faulkner, and intervened. Both he and Faulkner were shot in the ensuing confrontation. Despite witnesses who reported a shooter fleeing the scene, Mumia--who nearly died from his wounds--was arrested and charged with Faulkner\u0027s murder.\nThe case against him was full of holes, but prosecutors succeeded in sending Mumia to death row--thanks especially to the misconduct of trial judge Albert Sabo, a life member of the FOP who handed out more death sentences than any other judge in the modern era of the death penalty.\nMumia didn\u0027t remain silent on death row--on the contrary, he became the \"voice of the voiceless,\" penning several books and numerous articles from his tiny cell. National Public Radio offered to air his radio commentaries, but censored them at the last minute after a campaign by the FOP.\nWith Stan Tookie Williams\u0027 execution only days away, Mumia won a new federal appeal that could lead to a new trial--and hopefully his freedom.\n","source":"google_52778140979861"}

But they failed to clarify the aspects of her case that have changed over the past forty years, to prompt them to do so.\nAt yesterday’s press conference, Aaron T. Ford, agent in charge of the FBI’s Newark division, announced the placement of Joanne Chesimard on the FBI’s “Terrorism” list, and the doubling of the reward for her capture to $2,000,000.\nHas the FBI has redefined what makes a US citizen a terrorist?\nAddressing the press, Agent Ford stated “While living openly and freely in Cuba she (Joanne Chesimard) continues to maintain and promote her terrorist ideology. She provides anti US Government speeches espousing the Black Liberation Army message of revolution and terrorism. No person, no matter what his or her politics or moral convictions are, is above the law.”\nJoanne Chesimard is a convicted felon. Whether or not she received a fair trial for the crimes she is accused of committing is for the courts and history to decide.\nHowever, her designation by the FBI as a terrorist raises the question, does living on the lam in foreign country, proselytizing views (hateful or not), to anyone who will listen, make Chesimard a terrorist?\nNo one is above the law. However, Article I of the constitution prevents congress from abridging a citizen’s freedom of speech, and also allows a citizen to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\nDoes the fact that Ms. Chesimard escaped justice and absconded to Cuba in order to spout-off revoke her rights as an American? If an American is on vacation in France, is he at risk of being labeled a terrorist if he voices disagreement with a particular US policy?    \nFrom February 15, 1977 to March 25, 1977, Ms. Chesimard was tried and convicted of first-degree murder, second-degree murder, atrocious assault and battery, assault and battery against a police officer, assault with a dangerous weapon, assault with intent to kill, illegal possession of a weapon, and armed robbery. She was also tried between 1971 and 1973 for two separate instances of bank robbery, and one count of kidnapping, but was acquitted of those charges.\nShe has never been charged with terrorism. Why is she suddenly, according to agent Ford, “a supreme terror against the government”?\nMs. Chesimard, who was once a member of the Black Panther Party and later joined the Black Liberation Army, proclaims that she is innocent and calls herself the victim of a racist judicial system.\nAccording to the New York Times , Lennox S. Hinds, a professor of criminal justice at Rutgers who defended Ms. Chesimard in the murder case, “there is no evidence that she in fact either caused the death or was involved in the shooting of the state trooper.”\n“The allegation that Ms. Shakur is a terrorist is unfounded,” Professor Hinds said. “The attempt at this point by the New Jersey State Police to characterize her as a terrorist is designed to inflame the public who may be unfamiliar with the facts.” \nWhat we need is a clear definition of what makes someone a terrorist; especially if that someone is an American citizen. As difficult as it is to do so, we must scrutinize and defend the rights of all of our citizens; even those whose crimes are heinous and reprehensible; because if we don’t protect theirs, we will certainly lose ours. \nThis article is the copyrighted property of the writer and Communities @ WashingtonTimes.com.

In addition, the state of New Jersey announced it was adding $1 million to the FBIâ€™s $1 million reward for her capture. Shakur becomes the first woman ever to make the list and only the second domestic terrorist to be added to the list.\nAssata Shakur, the former Joanne Chesimard, was a member of the Black Panther Party and Black Liberation Army. She was convicted in the May 2, 1973 killing of a New Jersey police officer during a shoot-out that left one of her fellow activists dead. She was shot twice by police during the incident. In 1979, she managed to escape from jail. Shakur fled to Cuba where she received political asylum. She once wrote, \"I am a 20th century escaped slave. Because of government persecution, I was left with no other choice than to flee from the political repression, racism and violence that dominate the U.S. governmentâ€™s policy towards people of color.\"\nIn 1998, Democracy Now! aired Shakur reading an open letter to Pope John Paul II during his trip to Cuba.  She wrote the message after New Jersey state troopers sent the Pope a letter asking him to call for her extradition.\nRUSH TRANSCRIPT\nI hope this letter finds you in good health, in good disposition, and enveloped with the spirit of goodness. I must confess that it had never occurred to me before to write you, and I find myself overwhelmed and moved to have this opportunity.\nAlthough circumstances have compelled me to reach out to you, I am glad to have this occasion to try and cross the boundaries that would otherwise tend to separate us.\nI understand that the New Jersey State Police have written to you and asked you to intervene and to help facilitate my extradition back to the United States. I believe that their request is unprecedented in history. Since they have refused to make their letter to you public, although they have not hesitated to publicize their request, I am completely uninformed as to the accusations they are making against me. Why, I wonder, do I warrant such attention? What do I represent that is such a threat?\nPlease let me take a moment to tell you about myself. My name is Assata Shakur and I was born and raised in the United States. I am a descendant of Africans who were kidnapped and brought to the Americas as slaves. I spent my early childhood in the racist segregated South. I later moved to the northern part of the country, where I realized that Black people were equally victimized by racism and oppression.\nI grew up and became a political activist, participating in student struggles, the anti-war movement, and, most of all, in the movement for the liberation of African Americans in the United States. I later joined the Black Panther Party, an organization that was targeted by the COINTELPRO program, a program that was set up by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to eliminate all political opposition to the U.S. governmentâ€™s policies, to destroy the Black Liberation Movement in the United States, to discredit activists and to eliminate potential leaders.\nUnder the COINTELPRO program, many political activists were harassed, imprisoned, murdered or otherwise neutralized. As a result of being targeted by COINTELPRO, I, like many other young people, was faced with the threat of prison, underground, exile or death. The FBI, with the help of local police agencies, systematically fed false accusations and fake news articles to the press accusing me and other activists of crimes we did not commit. Although in my case the charges were eventually dropped or I was eventually acquitted, the national and local police agencies created a situation where, based on their false accusations against me, any police officer could shoot me on sight. It was not until the Freedom of Information Act was passed in the mid-\u002770s that we began to see the scope of the United States government\u0027s persecution of political activists.\nAt this point, I think that it is important to make one thing very clear. I have advocated and I still advocate revolutionary changes in the structure and in the principles that govern the United States. I advocate self-determination for my people and for all oppressed inside the United States. I advocate an end to capitalist exploitation, the abolition of racist policies, the eradication of sexism, and the elimination of political repression. If that is a crime, then I am totally guilty.\nTo make a long story short, I was captured in New Jersey in 1973, after being shot with both arms held in the air, and then shot again from the back. I was left on the ground to die and when I did not, I was taken to a local hospital where I was threatened, beaten and tortured. In 1977 I was convicted in a trial that can only be described as a legal lynching.\nIn 1979 I was able to escape with the aid of some of my fellow comrades. I saw this as a necessary step, not only because I was innocent of the charges against me, but because I knew that in the racist legal system in the United States I would receive no justice. I was also afraid that I would be murdered in prison. I later arrived in Cuba where I am currently living in exile as a political refugee.\nThe New Jersey State Police and other law enforcement officials say they want to see me brought to \"justice.\" But I would like to know what they mean by \"justice.\" Is torture justice? I was kept in solitary confinement for more than two years, mostly in menâ€™s prisons. Is that justice? My lawyers were threatened with imprisonment and imprisoned. Is that justice? I was tried by an all-white jury, without even the pretext of impartiality, and then sentenced to life in prison plus 33 years. Is that justice?\nLet me emphasize that justice for me is not the issue I am addressing here; it is justice for my people that is at stake. When my people receive justice, I am sure that I will receive it, too. I know that Your Holiness will reach your own conclusions, but I feel compelled to present the circumstances surrounding the application of so-called \"justice\" in New Jersey. I am not the first or the last person to be victimized by the New Jersey system of \"justice.\" The New Jersey State Police are infamous for their racism and brutality. Many legal actions have been filed against them and just recently, in a class action legal proceeding, the New Jersey State Police were found guilty of having an, quote, \"officially sanctioned, de facto policy of targeting minorities for investigation and arrest,\" unquote.\nAlthough New Jerseyâ€™s population is more than 78 percent white, more than 75 percent of the prison population is made up of Blacks and Latinos. Eighty percent of women in New Jersey prisons are women of color. There are 15 people on death row in the state and seven of them are Black. A 1987 study found that New Jersey prosecutors sought the death penalty in 50 percent of cases involving a Black defendant and a white victim, but only 28 percent of cases involving a Black defendant and a Black victim.\nUnfortunately, the situation in New Jersey is not unique, but reflects the racism that permeates the entire country. The United States has the highest rate of incarceration in the world. There are more than 1.7 million people in U.S. prisons. This number does not include the more than 500,000 people in city and county jails, nor does it include the alarming number of children in juvenile institutions. The vast majority of those behind bars are people of color and virtually all of those behind bars are poor. The result of this reality is devastating. One third of Black men between the ages of 20 and 29 are either in prison or under the jurisdiction of the criminal justice system.\nPrisons are big business in the United States, and the building, running, and supplying of prisons has become the fastest growing industry in the country. Factories are being moved into the prisons and prisoners are being forced to work for slave wages. This super-exploitation of human beings has meant the institutionalization of a new form of slavery. Those who cannot find work on the streets are forced to work in prison.\nNot only are the prisons used as instruments of economic exploitation, they also serve as instruments of political repression. There are more than 100 political prisoners in the United States. They are African Americans, Puerto Ricans, Chicanos, Native Americans, Asians, and progressive white people who oppose the policies of the United States government. Many of those targeted by the COINTELPRO program have been in prison since the early 1970s.\nAlthough the situation in the prisons is an indication of human rights violations inside the United States, there are other, more deadly indicators.\nThere are currently 3,365 people now on death row, and more than 50 percent of those awaiting death are people of color. Black people make up only 13 percent of the population, but we make up 41.01 percent of persons who have received the death penalty. The number of state assassinations has increased drastically. In 1997 alone, 71 people were executed.\nA special rapporteur appointed by the United Nations organization found serious human rights violations in the United States, especially those related to the death penalty. According to his findings, people who were mentally ill were sentenced to death, people with severe mental and learning disabilities, as well as minors under 18. Serious racial bias was found on the part of judges and prosecutors. Specifically mentioned in the report was the case of Mumia Abu-Jamal, the only political prisoner on death row, who was sentenced to death because of his political beliefs and because of his work as a journalist, exposing police brutality in the city of Philadelphia.\nI believe that some people spell God with one \"O\" while others spell it with two. What we call God is unimportant, as long as we do Godâ€™s work. There are those who want to see Godâ€™s wrath fall on the oppressed and not on the oppressors. I believe that the time has ended when slavery, colonialism, and oppression can be carried out in the name of religion. It was in the dungeons of prison that I felt the presence of God up close, and it has been my belief in God, and in the goodness of human beings that has helped me to survive. I am not ashamed of having been in prison, and I am certainly not ashamed of having been a political prisoner. I believe that Jesus was a political prisoner who was executed because he fought against the evils of the Roman Empire, because he fought against the greed of the money changers in the temple, because he fought against the sins and injustices of his time. As a true child of God, Jesus spoke up for the poor, for the meek, for the sick, and the oppressed. The early Christians were thrown into lionsâ€™ dens. I will try and follow the example of so many who have stood up in the face of overwhelming oppression.\nI am not writing to ask you to intercede on my behalf. I ask nothing for myself. I only ask you to examine the social reality of the United States and to speak out against the human rights violations that are taking place.\nOn this day, the birthday of Martin Luther King, I am reminded of all those who gave their lives for freedom. Most of the people who live on this planet are still not free. I ask only that you continue to work and pray to end oppression and political repression. It is my heartfelt belief that all the people on this earth deserve justice: social justice, political justice, and economic justice. I believe it is the only way we will ever achieve peace and prosperity on this earth. I hope that you enjoy your visit to Cuba. This is not a country that is rich in material wealth, but it is a country that is rich in human wealth, spiritual wealth and moral wealth.\nRespectfully yours,\n","source":"google_52778140979861"}

Many MSM writers, editors, and commentators are conjuring up ridiculous explanations to justify being AWOL on this important story, but a few liberal-left journalists have admitted that this is a case where their fellow “progressives” in the media have allowed their overwhelming “pro-choice” bias to run rampant, to the point of engaging in willful, blatant censorship.\nKermit Gosnell has killed many more children than Adam Lanza, the accused gunman in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. “Doctor” Gosnell cold-bloodedly murdered hundreds of children in especially gruesome ways — and even joked about it. His total death toll over the past four decades includes thousands of babies, most of whom were black, Hispanic, or Asian. Just about everyone has heard of Adam Lanza, although very little factual data is actually known about the troubled youth. Dr. Gosnell, on the other hand, carried out his decades-long murder spree under the protection of pro-abortion politicians and media organizations that were intentionally blind to his activities — until his crimes became so obvious and publicly offensive that they were forced to disassociate themselves from him by portraying his as an outlier who is unrepresentative of the abortion industry.\nOn March 18 the Philadelphia abortionist went on trial  for the murder of seven babies who were born alive, but whom he then killed by “snipping” their spines. He was also charged in the death of one of the mothers on whom he had performed an abortion.\nGosnell — Given Immunity to Act With Impunity\nThe c ounty grand jury report  on Gosnell’s “House of Horrors” and the testimony heard at trial show a butcher who was able to act with impunity decade after decade while carrying out unspeakable crimes. Why was Gosnell able to get away with his abominable activity for so long?  He was able to act with impunity because he was given immunity by his pro-abortion allies in the media and in government, the very people charged with protecting the public from monsters such as Gosnell. And this de facto immunity has been reinforced by the almost complete MSM blackout — until recently — of the Gosnell trial.\nProfessor Admits: “Those of us on the Left have made a decision not to cover this trial”\nWhile most of the MSM commentariat — almost universally pro-abortion — continue to insist that there is, and has been, no conscious effort by the media to censor this story, a few have been more candid. Professor Marc Lamont Hill of Columbia University is one who has admitted what millions of Americans already knew to be the case.\n“For what it’s worth, I do think that those of us on the Left have made a decision not to cover this trial because we worry that it’ll compromise abortion rights,” Professor Hill said . “Whether you agree with abortion or not, I do think there’s a direct connection between the media’s failure to cover this and our own political commitments on the Left.”\n“I think it’s a bad idea,” Hill said of the blackout. “I think it’s dangerous, but I think that’s the way it is.”\nProfessor Hill is not just your run-of-the-mill “liberal”; he’s a hardcore radical Marxist who has treated recent murderer/cop-killer Christopher Dorner as a folk hero , as well as defending  Maoist-communist Van Jones and Weather Underground terrorist/cop-killer Assata Shakur (aka Joanne Chesimard).\nAnother welcome admission came from Melinda Henneberger of the Washington Post, one of the establishment media organs most culpable for spiking the Gosnell story. In an April 15 column entitled “Why Kermit Gosnell hasn’t been on Page One,”  Henneberger made this extraordinary confession: \nI say we didn’t write more because the only abortion story most outlets ever cover in the news pages is every single threat or perceived threat to abortion rights. In fact, that is so fixed a view of what constitutes coverage of that issue that it’s genuinely hard, I think, for many journalists to see a story outside that paradigm as news. That’s not so much a conscious decision as a reflex, but the effect is one-sided coverage. \nYes, no conscious conspiracy here, just an overwhelming ideological reflex that manifests itself in a lockstep conformity that tolerates no conflicting narratives, opinions, or inconvenient facts.\nTo her credit, Henneberger is uncomfortable with this reflexive conformity and takes her colleagues to task for covering up for the egregious Gosnell.\nCovering Everything Except Gosnell’s House of Horrors\nSimple question: Which is the more important story, the Gosnell “House of Horrors” mass-murder trial or the firing of Rutgers basketball coach Mike Rice for making “homophobic” slurs? Obviously, in our politically correct culture — as dictated by the PC media police — the latter is far more important, as this story from Newsbusters powerfully reveals.\nNewsbusters’ Matthew Philbin wrote on April 9: \nThe Rutgers basketball story continues to transfix the media, and why shouldn’t it? Mike Rice, the disgraced former Rutgers basketball coach allegedly killed a woman and at least seven viable, born-alive babies “by plunging scissors into their spinal cords” in his filthy, macabre “house of horrors” abortion clinic.\nOh wait, my mistake. Rice was fired last week from Rutgers over video of him shoving, kicking and yelling at his players, throwing basketballs at them and — most damning — using “homophobic slurs.” That’s made Rice the most notorious villain in America. And in one week it earned him 36 network news stories clocking in at 41 minutes, 26 seconds of air time on ABC, CBS and NBC.\nNow, had Rice been accused of killing a woman and eight babies, he’d be enjoying the same anonymity as Kermit Gosnell — provided the killings were carried out in an abortion clinic. Gosnell is the West Philadelphia abortionist who ran an unimaginable charnel house of a “clinic,” for 30 years. Witnesses testified that he may have murdered over 100 babies outside the womb. Gosnell’s trial, underway for weeks, has featured wrenching testimony and horrific details. And it has received exactly zero seconds of airtime on the broadcast networks. \nHere’s the news story scorecard:\n• Coach Rice’s terrible “crime” of a momentary slip of the tongue and some over-the-top, unsportsmanlike, unprofessional behavior —  36 network news stories; \n• Gosnell’s gruesome abattoir of death — zero, zip, nada. \nNewsflash: This is called a blackout. Or, in traditional newspaper parlance, we would say the story was spiked — big time. And Henneberger’s reflexive explanation notwithstanding, a blackout or spiking this universal bespeaks conscious, deliberate choice. Surely, at least some cub reporter somewhere, remembering the basics from Journalism 101, must have asked some newsroom editor: “Gee, this Gosnell trial looks interesting; do you want me to cover it?” If so, that editor must have quickly enlightened the neophyte on newsroom priorities (not to mention PC etiquette) and redirected the cub to the real news we can’t do without: Coach Rice’s rant, the latest celebrity wardrobe malfunction, anything Kardashian, or the umpteen thousandth story on why the Newtown shooting means the NRA is evil and we need more gun control laws.\nThat Newsbuster Gosnell/Rice scorecard report was on April 9, but the picture hasn’t gotten much better since then. Although many MSM organizations have been shamed into offering some coverage of the Gosnell case, they invariably have tried to “balance” their coverage by inviting spokesmen from Planned Parenthood, NARAL, and other pro-abortion organizations to spin the story to fit a “pro-choice” narrative. \nAs Newsbusters reported on April 24 ( “MSNBC Finally Covers Gosnell Trial in Primetime Five Weeks After it Began” ) MSNBC’s Chris Matthews, even while admitting the horrific nature of Gosnell’s crimes, tried to turn the story into a pro-abortion apologia. \"Everybody in our office, all producers, mostly women, are appalled at this,\" Matthews said. \"They can`t even read these articles. It\u0027s so tough. I had a hard time reading them. It\u0027s beyond belief that there was something going on like this, without getting into the testimony questions. If it\u0027s even like this at all, it\u0027s horrible.\"\nYes, horrible, but even more so because the media organizations that should have been exposing the horrors were actually covering it up and ignoring or belittling the evidence that pro-life advocates had been presenting for years about the goings-on at Gosnell’s slaughterhouse.\nNevertheless, as to be expected, many on the Left completely reject any accusation or suggestion that there has been any effort to stifle coverage of the Gosnell story. Rawstory.com ran this article  by Jill Filipovic of the Guardian claiming that the fuss about the MSM’s lack of coverage is a complete fiction made up by a national conspiracy of pro-life zealots.\nAnd MediaMatters.org, the far-Left propaganda font for everything “progressive,” claims that the Gosnell case is actually an indictment of the pro-life movement, because restrictions on abortion have “forced” women to seek out the services of monsters such as Gosnell.\nFor additional information and perspective on the MSM’s shutout of the Gosnell story, we suggest these posts by James Velasquez at Policymic.com,  Michelle Malkin , and John Nolte at Breitbart.com. \nHere are some of the stories from The New American covering the Gosnell case:\n","source":"google_52778140979861"}

Chesimard, who now calls herself Assata Shakur, was convicted of the murder of Trooper Werner Foerster but escaped from prison in 1979 and has been living in Cuba under the protection of Fidel Castro’s government. Brooklyn Councilman Charles Barron on Tuesday, May 24, 2005, is calling on the United States to rescind the $1 million bounty for Chesimard, describing her as an innocent victim of racial bias. Photo: AP Photo/New Jersey State Police\n(FinalCall.com) - One man’s freedom fighter is another man’s terrorist and so goes the story of Assata Shakur. To many around the world, Assata Shakur is a freedom fighter that escaped the chains of oppression to Cuba where she has been living in exile since 1984.\nThe FBI doesn’t see it that way and classified her in 2005 as a domestic terrorist and offered a $1 million reward for assistance in her capture.\nNew Jersey’s Attorney General Jeffery S. Chiesa announced in February with the support of New Jersey’s State Police that they want to add Ms. Shakur (born Joanne Chesimard) to the FBI’s Top Ten and the Top 25 Most Wanted Terrorists lists plus increase the reward for her capture from $1 million to $5 million.\n“Adding Chesimard to your Top Ten list and the Top 25 Most Wanted Terrorists lists would very much aid local New Jersey law enforcement in their efforts to finally bring Joanne Chesimard to justice,” wrote New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez to FBI Director Robert Mueller.\n“Given that law enforcement has worked collaboratively on this effort for nearly 33 years, I feel these final steps are necessary to ensure that Chesimard is captured and returned to the United States to serve her sentence.”\nOn March 10, in Newark, the New Black Panther Party rallied ‘In Defense of Assata.’\n“We are pathetically living in an era where the U.S. government’s foreign policy is crippling the world with its doctrine of ‘Regime Change,’” explained an angry Zayid Muhammad, a longtime friend and supporter of Shakur and organizer of the rally.\n“This new attack is highly provocative and is not only a renewed threat on Assata’s life, it could be a real, election year opportunistic, threat to the national sovereignty of Cuba.”\nMr. Muhammad is concerned that in an economic crisis raising the reward is provocative and might encourage people interested in the money to respond militarily against Cuba. He told The Final Call, “This is a threat to peace. People should be warned that Cuba would defend itself if attacked.”\n“This is a matter of principle. She’s our sister, our freedom fighter. I’m one of her cubs. This is a propaganda campaign to further demonize her. When the devil acts up the righteous have to do what we have to.”\nThe year is 1973 and an incident of what would now be called “racial profiling” takes place on the New Jersey Turnpike. Ms. Shakur, actively involved in the Black Liberation Army, is traveling with Malik Zayad Shakur (no relation) and Sundiata Acoli. State troopers stop them, reportedly because of a broken headlight.\nThe three are made to exit the car with their hands up. All of a sudden, shots are fired.\nThat much everybody seems to agree on.\nWhen all was said and done, State Trooper Werner Foerster and Malik Shakur were dead. Ms. Shakur and Mr. Acoli were charged with the death of state trooper Foerster.\nThe trial found them both guilty.\n“I was shot with my arms in the air. My wounds could not have happened unless my arms were in the air. The bullet went in under my arm and traveled past my clavicle. It is medically impossible for that to happen if my arms were down,” Ms. Shakur told The Final Call in a 2002 exclusive interview in Cuba .\n“I was sentenced to life plus 30 years by an all-White jury. What I saw in prison was wall-to-wall Black flesh in chains. Women caged in cells. But we’re the terrorists. It just doesn’t make sense.”\nShe spent six and a half years in prison, two of those in solitary confinement. During that time she gave birth to her daughter Kakuya.\nIn 1979 during a daring escape that continues to infuriate the New Jersey State Troopers, she was freed. There was a nation-wide search for her. In 1984 she went to Cuba and was united with her daughter.\n“I felt it was important for me to be there,” Gail Walker, Executive Director of Pastors for Peace that coordinates humanitarian aid to Cuba told The Final Call.\n“The rhetoric and vitriol about her is still so high. It’s amazing,” she said. “Ironically someone so physically and emotionally disconnected from her family for all of these years still gets this kind of publicity.”\n“For those of us who have traveled to Cuba and understand the role she’s played and Cuba’s role in social issues have to be supportive. She’s an inspiration.”\nRelated news:\n","source":"google_52778140979861"}

As the ailing convicted perpetrator of the second-worst terrorist attack in history against U.S. civilians is sunning himself amid cheers, flowers and hugs in Tripoli, an examination of the outcomes of other terrorism cases over the last century, big and small, yields its own pattern of disappointments.\nEven before Megrahi’s release last week the case presented extreme difficulties for authorities and families alike. The trial, held by agreement in the Netherlands, not Scotland, commenced well over a decade after the attack, and a co-defendant was acquitted. By the time of his release Megrahi would have served about 12 days imprisonment for each life he took. \n Of the other top five terrorist attacks against U.S. citizens besides Pan Am 103, only two resulted in the arrest and conviction of a perpetrator. The April 19, 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City Murrah federal building that killed 168 resulted in the execution of bomber Timothy McVeigh by lethal injection in 2001. For the other conviction, one has to go back almost a century to the 1910 bombing of the Los Angeles Times building which killed 21. For the rest of the most deadly attacks perpetrators escaped the bar of justice either by eluding capture--some permanently, or choosing the method and timing of their own demise.\nTerrorist Incidents Directed Towards Americans by U.S. Deaths\n1. 9/11 Attacks, Incendiary Bombing by Aircraft, NY, DC, PA   2975 killed, 9/11/ 2001 Al Qaeda\n2.

Los Angeles Times Bldg., Bombing, Los Angeles, CA, 21killed, 10/01/ 1910, Union militants\n \nThe 19 perpetrators of 9/11, the worst terrorist attack against Americans which killed over 2970 people, yielded no trial, but tons of conspiracy theorists.  All the direct murderers died in the crashes. The October 1983 truck bomb attack, allegedly by a precursor of Hizbollah, that killed 241 sleeping servicemen on a contentious, but internationally designated peacekeeping mission, never resulted in a criminal trial. Accused mastermind Imad Mughniyah was allegedly involved in a string of brazen kidnappings and fatal bombings against American civilians, as well as government and military officials. He was eventually indicted by American authorities on another charge.  The indictment stemmed from his masterminding of the hijacking of TWA flight 847 in 1985 where a U.S. sailor was murdered and dumped from the rear of the aircraft in Beirut. He was also indicted in Argentina for bombings against Israeli and Jewish targets in incidents that killed the most Jewish civilians since World War II. Mugniyah eluded capture by the U.S. in separate incidents where the French and Saudis thwarted the attempts. He also skirted death along with his spiritual advisor, when a car bomber allegedly tied to the U.S, killed 62 Lebanese civilians instead.  His luck finally ran out decades later when a bomb from an unknown assailant exploded in his car in Syria in February 2008.\nThe September 1920 bombing of Wall Street was the worst terrorist attack in American history at the time. The horse drawn bomb killed over 35 people, but the attack by suspected anarchists was never solved. The Bath School bombings in May 1927, by an anti-tax school board member, who blamed taxation for his financial distress, claimed 44 other Michiganders, the majority of whom were grade school children. The bomber Andrew Kehoe died in one of the blasts.  A smaller, more recent blast at LaGuardia airport in 1975 remains unsolved.\nThis year has seen its own set of heartbreaks. The Palestinian terrorist who in 1985 ruthlessly killed Leon Klinghoffer, an elderly American wheelchair bound tourist was released from an Italian prison this April for “good behavior” -seven years short of his thirty-year sentence. Klinghoffer was aboard the hijacked ocean liner, the Achille Lauro, when he was shot in the head and dumped into the sea. The actual mastermind of the attack Abu Abbas was convicted in absentia in Italy, but evaded authorities until his April 2003 capture by U.S. Special Forces. He died less then a year later of natural causes.\nIn a related, but still unsolved domestic terror attack, Alex Odeh, West Coast director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, was murdered by a bomb blast in Orange County, California. Jewish extremists, including one deceased and one serving a life sentence, along with others perhaps in Israel, were suspected but never charged. It is believed Odeh was targeted by terrorists for advocating support of the Palestinian cause during the course of the Achille Lauro hijacking.\nCases from the racial turmoil of decades ago continue to reverberate today. Two adjudicated cop killers from the Black Liberation Army have apparently outflanked the legal system. The BLA is believed responsible for the death of at least 15 police officers in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Herman Bell, already serving a life sentence in a New York prison for murdering two police officers in Harlem in May 1971, was given probation this summer in California for the shotgun killing of a San Francisco police sergeant in August of that year. FBI Most wanted Joanne Chesimard, 61 remains at large in Cuba after armed cohorts sprang her from prison in 1979. She was convicted of the execution style murder of New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foester. Both are regarded as folk heroes by some on the far left.\nEarlier this month, racist Billy Wayne Posey, a prime suspect in a Klan murder conspiracy died of natural causes at 73. Posey was allegedly involved in the infamous murders of three young civil rights workers, two Jewish and one African-American, near Philadelphia, Mississippi in 1964. A grand jury, with a relative of Posey’s on it failed to indict him by one vote. The only person to face state murder charges, Edgar Ray Killen was found guilty of manslaughter in 2005. Mr. Posey outlived all of the victims\u0027 mothers including Fannie Lee Chaney and Carolyn Goodman who passed at 84 and 91, respectively in 2007. The death comes less than three weeks after a group of civil rights experts conferred with Attorney General Eric Holder about civil rights era “cold cases” including this one.\nThe sometimes-conflicting goals of the American justice system are deterrence (discouraging crime), retribution (proportionate punishment), incapacitation (removing the dangerous offender from society), and rehabilitation (reforming attitudes). These cornerstones of justice are undermined when homicidal extremists from long ago cases kill innocents and evade appropriate punishment. It sends the wrong message to victims’ families today and would be terrorists tomorrow.\n \n","source":"google_52778140979861"}

It would cause $122 billion in damage — and that doesn’t include losses from fires, which were the most destructive part of the 1906 earthquake.\nIn light of those numbers, many scientists and disaster experts are exasperated at what they see as a lack of urgency from government officials.\nKen Verosub, a geology professor at the University of California at Davis, was a member of the California Task Force on Earthquake Preparedness, which Gov. Jerry Brown created in 1979. The task force worked for only six years, however, before Gov. George Deukmejian disbanded it in 1985.\n“The fact that it no longer exists is a telling commentary, I think, on where we are,” Verosub said.\nMore attention has been paid since the Loma Prieta earthquake, which hit to the south of the city, but inadequate projects to retrofit major structures and critical infrastructure for years before mean little can be done to mitigate destruction if a catastrophic earthquake were to hit in the next few years.\nFor example, fewer than half of the 109 local governments in the region had retrofitted or replaced even one municipal structure to withstand an earthquake, the nonprofit Earthquake Engineering Research Institute reported in 2002.\nFewer than half of all older single-family homes in the region had undergone retrofitting, the American Society of Home Inspectors found in 1998, and no more than 15 percent were projected to be habitable. In multi-family dwellings, the Association of Bay Area Governments concluded from census data, more than half a million residents in the region could be displaced.\n“It’s going to cause major damage, and there’s very little that can be done in the short term to reduce that level of damage,” Andrews said.\nFirst responders left hobbled\n“Lessons come at a steep price,” said Joanne Hayes-White, chief of the San Francisco Fire Department. Her department would be among the first responders to any big earthquake in San Francisco and San Francisco County, and it is designated as the lead coordinator of a regional response.\nHayes-White said she was confident that authorities would respond heroically to a repeat of the 1906 earthquake. Since 1950, many of California’s local governments have been joined in a mutual-aid compact, and she said they had all learned a great deal after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. New strategies and tactics have been born, and she is especially proud of advanced disaster-training programs she shepherded.\nStill, Hayes-White said at a special hearing before the San Francisco Fire Commission this month, tough economic times have slowed the momentum: “For the last few years, our fire department has not been as up to speed [in acquiring and maintaining modern equipment] as I would have liked.”\nFor instance, the department has just two fire boats to navigate the bay waters that surround the city on three sides. They would be indispensable in reaching fires made inaccessible by damaged roads, but the department is constantly fighting off proposals to decommission one or even both to save money.\n","source":"google_52778140979861"}

In so doing, they also increased the bounty on her head from $150,000 to an unprecedented $1,000,000.\nViewed through the lens of U.S. law enforcement, Shakur is an escaped cop-killer. Viewed through the lens of many Black people, including me, she is a wrongly convicted woman and a hero of epic proportions.\nMy first memory of Assata Shakur was the \"Wanted\" posters all over my Brooklyn neighborhood. They said her name was Joanne Chesimard, that she was a killer, an escaped convict, and armed and dangerous.\nThey made her sound like a super-villain, like something out of a comic book. But even then, as a child, I couldn\u0027t believe what I was being told.\nMos Def\nWhen I looked at those posters and the mug shot of a slight, brown, high-cheekboned woman with a\nfull afro, I saw someone who looked like she was in my family, an aunt, a mother.\nShe looked like she had soul. Later, as a junior high school student, when I read her autobiography, Assata, I would discover that not only did she have soul, she also had immeasurable heart, courage and love.\nAnd I would come to believe that that very heart and soul she possessed was exactly why Assata Shakur was shot, arrested, framed and convicted of the murder of a New Jersey State Trooper.\nThere are some undisputed facts about the case. On May 2nd, 1973, Assata Shakur, a Black Panther, was driving down the New Jersey State Turnpike with two companions, Zayd Shakur and Sundiata Acoli.\nThe three were pulled over, ostensibly for a broken tail light. A gun battle ensued, why and how it\nstarted is unclear. But the aftermath is not. Trooper Werner Forester and Zayd Shakur lay dead.\nSundiata Acoli escaped [he was captured two days later]. And Assata was shot and arrested. At trial, three neurologists would testify that the first gunshot shattered her clavicle and the second shattered the median nerve in her right hand. That testimony proved that she was sitting with her hands raised when she was fired on by police.\nFurther testimony proved that no gun residue was found on either of her hands, nor were her finger prints found on any of the weapons located at the scene. Nevertheless, Shakur was convicted by an all-White jury and sentenced to life in prison.\nSix years and six months to the day that she was arrested, and aided by friends, Shakur escaped from Clinton Women\u0027s Prison in New Jersey. As a high school student I remember seeing posters all around the Brooklyn community I lived in that read: Assata Shakur is Welcome Here. In 1984, she surfaced in Cuba and was granted political asylum by Fidel Castro.\nThere are those who believe that being convicted of a crime makes you guilty. But that imposes an assumption of infallibility upon our criminal justice system.\nWhen Assata Shakur was convicted of killing Werner Forester, not only had the Black Panther Party been labeled by then F.B.I. director, J. Edgar Hoover, as \"the greatest internal threat\" to American security, but Assata herself had been thoroughly criminalized in the minds of the American public; she\u0027d been charged in six different crimes ranging from attempted murder to bank robbery, and her acquittal or dismissal of the charges outright notwithstanding, to the average citizen, it seemed she must be guilty of something. And she was. She was guilty of calling for a shift in power in America, and for racial and economic justice.\nIncluded on a short list of the many people who have made that call and were either criminalized, terrorized, killed or blacklisted are Paul Robeson, Martin Luther King, Schwerner, Chaney and Goodman, Medgar Evers and Ida B. Wells.\nPerhaps what is most insulting about the government\u0027s latest attack on Assata is that while they vigorously pursue her extradition, a few years ago using it as a bargaining chip for lifting the embargo itself, they have been decidedly lackadaisical in pursuing the extradition to Venezuela of an admitted terrorist, Florida resident Luis Posada Carriles. Carriles is likely responsible for blowing up a Cuban airline in 1976, an act which claimed the lives of some 73 innocent civilians.\nFor those of us who either remember the state of the union in the 1960s and 1970s or have studied it, when we consider Assata Shakur living under political asylum in Cuba, we believe that nation is exercising its political sovereignty, and in no way harboring a terrorist.\nCubans sees Assata as I, and many others in my community do: as a woman who was and is persecuted for her political beliefs.\nWhen the federal government raised the bounty on her head this May 2, one official declared that Assata was merely \"120 pounds of money.\" For many of us in the Black community she could never be so reduced. For many of us in the Black community, she was and remains, to use her own words, an \"escaped slave,\" a heroine, not unlike Harriet Tubman.\nMOS DEF, an actor and rapper, is currently starring in The Hitchhiker\u0027s Guide to the Galaxy.\nPage   1  of 1\n","source":"google_52778140979861"}

I miss the look of recognition Black women give each other, the understanding we express without saying a word.?\n(FinalCall.com) - The 32nd anniversary of the death of New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster was commemorated by the state placing a $1 million bounty on Assata Shakur, who was convicted of his murder, but later escaped from a New Jersey jail. She now lives in exile in Cuba.\nState Police Superintendent Col. Rick Fuentes told reporters at a May 2 press conference that he hopes the sweetened reward will encourage someone to come forward with information leading to the capture of Ms. Shakur, formerly known as Joanne Chesimard, according to Newsday.\n“We have pretty long institutional memories,” Col. Fuentes said. “This is a debt that she owes to the residents of the state of New Jersey for the crimes she committed.\nOn the same day, the Justice Department added her name to the FBI’s domestic terrorists list.\n“Anyone of the mindset that would execute a police officer once they were on the ground is dangerous enough to be considered a domestic terrorism threat,” Col. Fuentes said.\nAttorney General Alberto Gonzalez, according to Newsday, personally approved the money from the Justice Department. It will be paid for information leading to her safe capture, but not if she is killed in the process.\n“The goal is to bring a fully functional, no-assembly-required fugitive back home to New Jersey, so she can finish out her term of imprisonment,” Col. Fuentes said.\nWould Ms. Shakur be concerned that her name is now on the U.S. terrorists list? This writer doubts it. Here is what she said in 2002 in an exclusive interview with The Final Call newspaper:\n“When I was in the Black Panther Party, they (United States) called us terrorists. How dare they call us terrorists when we were being terrorized? Terror was a constant part of my life. I was living under apartheid in North Carolina. We lived under police terror.”\nRacial profiling circa 1973\nThe time is 1973 and an incident of what would now be called “racial profiling” takes place on the New Jersey Turnpike. Ms. Shakur, actively involved in the Black Liberation Army (BLA), is traveling with Malik Zayad Shakur (no relation) and Sundiata Acoli.\nState troopers stop them, reportedly because of a broken headlight. A trooper also explains they were “suspicious” because they had Vermont license plates. The three are made to exit the car with their hands up. All of a sudden, shots were fired.\nThat much everybody seems to agree on. When the smoke cleared, state trooper Werner Foerster and Malik Shakur were dead. Ms. Shakur and Mr. Acoli were charged with the death of state trooper Foerster.\nThe trial found them both guilty. The verdict was no surprise, but many questioned the racial injustice by the all-White jury and admitted perjury by the trial’s star witness.\n“I was shot with my arms in the air,” Ms. Shakur told The Final Call. “My wounds could not have happened unless my arms were in the air. The bullet went in under my arm and traveled past my clavicle. It is medically impossible for that to happen if my arms were down.”\nMs. Shakur has long maintained her innocence in the death of state trooper Foerster.\n“What happened afterward (the shooting) was typical in the era of COINTELPRO—the FBI’s crooked, covert operation intended to destabilize Black movements and their leaders—and out-and-out racism,” wrote columnist Tonyaa Weathersbee on blackamericaweb.com.\n“They found her guilty in spite of the fact that forensics experts testified that she was shot when she was in a position of surrender and that no evidence existed to show that she had fired a weapon.”\nShe added, “I doubt that Shakur killed Foerster. The forensics testimony, as well as the context of the times, is what makes me dubious.”\nThe height of hypocrisy\nThe offer of $1 million for the capture of Ms. Shakur has already interested bounty hunter Louis Faccone. He told Newsday, “I’m going to jump on it.”\nMr. Faccone explained that he could have a two-man team launched toward Cuba from the Florida Keys within hours of getting reliable information about Ms. Shakur’s whereabouts.\n“Some bounty hunter in Florida said he plans to try and capture Shakur,” wrote Ms. Weathersbee. “I hope he fails. I hope he fails, not only because I believe that Shakur was wrongly convicted, but because I believe it is the height of hypocrisy for the Bush administration to put her on the same terrorist watchlist as Osama bin Laden.”\n“It is also hypocritical because, right here in the United States, we are harboring a number of fugitives and murderers from other countries. And it’s sheer political lunacy to compare Shakur to bin Laden; she hasn’t killed 3,000 people, nor does she have the capability of carrying out terrorist attacks against the United States.”\nAfter Ms. Shakur’s conviction, she was sentenced to life plus 30 years. She spent six-and-a-half years in prison, two of those in solitary confinement. During that time, she gave birth to her daughter Kakuya.\nIn 1979, she was liberated by comrades in a daring escape that continues to infuriate the New Jersey State Troopers. There was a nationwide search for her. In 1984, she went to Cuba and was united with her daughter.\nWhat is it like to live in exile? What is it like to be away from family and friends?\n“Living in exile is hard. I miss my family and friends. I miss the culture, the music, how people talk and their creativity. I miss the look of recognition Black women give each other, the understanding we express without saying a word,” she shared.\n“I adjusted by learning to understand what was going on in the world. The Cubans helped me to adjust. I learned joys in life by learning other cultures. It was a privilege to come here to a rich culture.”\nPhoto: Courtesy, AfroCubaWeb.com\n \nFCN is a distributor (and not a publisher) of content   supplied by third parties.

Toni Morrison at Google: Author Toni Morrison speaks during an interview about her latest book \u0027Home,\u0027 during Google\u0027s online program series, Authors At Google, on Wednesday. IMAGE\n2/28/13\nemail\nThe Nobel laureate was the latest, and most literary in memory, of a long line of famous guests to talk about their craft.\nNEW YORK â€”Novelist Toni Morrison, speaking Wednesday to dozens of Google employees holding laptops and smartphones, shared her vision for how she would turn the search engine leader into a literary character.\n\"It\u0027s like a big, metal, claw-y machine in \u0027Transformers,\u0027\" she said, to much laughter, during a lunchtime gathering at Google\u0027s Manhattan offices. \"When they\u0027re threatened, they turn into a little radio, they turn into a little car. And then after you pass them by they come up again.\n\"They can be anything and everything.\"\nThe 82-year-old Nobel laureate was the latest, and most literary in memory, of a long line of famous guests from Stephen Colbert to Lady Gaga who since 2005 have dropped in on Google in New York and the home offices in Mountain View, Calif. After her talk, she stayed on to take questions online, part of Google\u0027s \"Hangout\" series.\nMorrison, battling the flu and sniffling through much of the afternoon, was promoting the paperback edition of her novel \"Home,\" published last year. But she also chatted about technology, teaching and creativity.\nMost of the attendees were young enough to be her grandchildren, and she clearly enjoyed startling them with candid talk about what she likes in literature (please don\u0027t bore her with stories about dating) and about how to use sex in fiction. The first lesson: Forget \"boobs and butts.\"\n\"When you write about physical attraction, someone falling in love, or making love, it\u0027s just so relentlessly boring,\" she said.\n\"So why don\u0027t you do something different? When I wrote \u0027Beloved\u0027 I had these guys watching Sethe (the main character) in a cornfield making love to this guy. You can\u0027t see her, they can see the tops of the corn, and then the language goes on. ... It\u0027s all about corn. And I had a guy say I\u0027ll never see corn the same way.\"\nUnlike Philip Roth, who announced recently he was done with fiction, Morrison has no plan to quit. She is working on a new novel but acknowledges she\u0027s having a hard time. The problem isn\u0027t the narrative itself but the time in which she\u0027s set the story â€” the present, an era she\u0027s still trying to understand.\nMorrison, an early endorser of Amazon.com\u0027s Kindle reading device and the author of prize winners including \"Song of Solomon,\" said she\u0027s not a Luddite and does keep up with the Internet, enough so that she much prefers the nonfiction she reads on blogs to fiction. And she credited the Internet as an information resource.\n\"It shortens research enormously, months of time you would normally spend in libraries, just trying to read books,\" she said.\nShe cited an example from her most recent novel, set in the 1950s.\n\"I was looking for documentation for who could not rent or buy property in Seattle,\" she said. \"And I knew black people couldn\u0027t, but I didn\u0027t have any real examples. But via Google I went through stuff and found these lease arrangements.\"\nBut the digital age can still catch her off guard. When on-stage interviewer Torrence Boone, a Google managing director, casually mentioned that their discussion would be replayed on the Internet, Morrison sounded as if caught in the act.\n\"You heard me say all that stuff about corn and stuff?\" she asked.\nâ€”â€”\nMSN News on Facebook and Twitter\nStay up to date on breaking news and current events.\nFriend us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/news.msn\nFollow us on Twitter: www.twitter.com/msnnews\n \n","source":"google_52778141428876"}

In this context, Clifford Stoll published his book The Cuckoo’s Egg, which has gone on to become a classic of IT literature. In the same year Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, Intel launched its brand new 486 processor with 25 MHz, and the Berlin Wall fell. Back then, though, computing was the preserve of small communities of much-ridiculed geeks, so 1989 remained in the collective memory as the year the Wall came down. Everything else was immediately forgotten.\nMore than two decades later, computers have not only become socially acceptable but, thanks to Apple, they are even status symbols. These days anyone going to a library for information, transferring money at a bank counter, or exchanging traditional “snail mail” business letters, normally does so as a private individual: in our professional environment it is almost impossible to avoid the use of search engines, online banking and email.\nWhat long-term impact will this development have on our lives?  It is clear that any attempt to predict the IT security landscape in 2030 will have to be a forecast of security and society in general. IT is now almost everywhere, and its scope will only increase in the future.\nTaking great steps towards the future\nFuture generations will pinpoint 2012 as the year where the hegemony of the traditional personal computer was ended – ironically by the very company that was once inseparably connected with it – Microsoft. Like Apple and Google, the Windows giant is also now opting for a multiple-device approach: cell phones, tablets and increasingly television sets with a built-in operating system are all steadily challenging the PC’s traditional dominance. Online cloud storage instead of a hard drive in the desktop computer, applications from the App Store instead of downloads from dubious websites – times are changing, just as surely as analogue cameras have been superseded by digital devices. Gradually, more sophisticated camera phones are in turn replacing these.  There is no doubt that analogue films, digicams and PCs will still exist in ten years’ time, but their heyday is past. Against this background, it would hardly be surprising if smartphones lost their current cachet as the must-have techie toy within the next five years, because augmented reality glasses are now the up and coming thing.\nThese are special optical aids – including a built-in camera, display and computer. The special feature of augmented reality is that for the wearer reality and computer-generated images merge together. Thanks to a continuously activated camera and the face recognition function, a poor memory for names won’t be a problem any longer as the name, age and profession of the person we are talking to will be automatically displayed next to his or her face. On holiday, foreign-language menus will simply be replaced by a translated version. And if you get lost, you can use the pedestrian navigation system to virtually project your path onto the pavement in front of you. Additionally, a multimedia diary based on the continuous data flow of the camera, the microphone and GPS will automatically be created. No need to be impatient: in 2013, Google plans to deliver its Google Glasses to developers, and other manufacturers will follow. This fusion of the real and the virtual world will change so many things in the coming years that we simply cannot overestimate the importance of this development.\nBut when it comes to technology, there is always a dark side: if millions of people walk around with cameras permanently activated, nothing outside their own houses will remain private. Society will monitor itself and it remains to be seen if and how a balance between technology and privacy can be maintained. Automatic deactivation of cameras at particular places is an option for which Apple has already filed a patent.\nAnother problem: even the sharpest minds can only use the information at their disposal. Seeing is believing, as the saying goes. Just imagine an activated augmented reality feature tricking you into thinking that the restaurant you were going to visit was infested with cockroaches – you’re going to go to the establishment across the street instead, aren’t you? We’ve already seen how these “opinions” can be manipulated by paid “customers” in relation to hotel ratings on the Internet – but we still get tricked. So the advertising industry itself will be particularly interested in “optimizing” our reality to suit its agenda. It really would be dangerous if the system as a whole were hacked without the person concerned realizing that he or she is living in a dream world which has nothing to do with reality.\nOf course, the future involves much more than just augmented reality. But even when putting aside fascinating future topics such as nanotechnology, genetic research or food-producing 3D printers, you certainly won’t be bored: the much-heralded Artificial Intelligence is closer than ever to becoming reality. In 1997, IBM’s Deep Blue defeated the Russian Garry Kasparov 3.5-2.5 (the chess world champion had managed to win the previous match played the year before) – but its success was based on enormous processing power rather than true intelligence. Nevertheless, in 2001, IBM launched the amazing Watson computer that managed to trump a 74 times Jeopardy winner in a quiz game. This victory was due to the language processing technology that has been perfected over the years and to algorithms capable of independently gaining new findings on the basis of existing data. In the same year, Apple presented Siri, an imperfect but nonetheless trend-setting digital assistant. As expected, Google has joined the scramble to develop the smartest computer system. In parallel, a number of other projects have been initiated – partly supported by EU funds – whose objective is to emulate a complete human brain in a computer. Whether they are creating digital assistants or artificial brains, researchers have the will and the financial backing to complete this long journey.\nUltimately, we are looking at nothing less than the complete autonomization of our environment: cleaning robots, cars, even houses. We’ve already seen the Google Car obtain a license in the state of Nevada this year, making it the first ever motor vehicle to be recognized as capable of driving itself without human input. There have also been great advances in the field of robotics research: recently, the US agency DARPA demonstrated a robot known as the Cheetah, which runs at 45 km/h, i.e. faster than any human being.  When these robots can be animated by genuine artificial intelligence, those visions we’ve seen in sci-fi films could start to become reality. Whether you look forward to all this or it just makes you shudder is up to you!\nEverything changes\nTelevision, PCs, laptops, tablets and smartphones\nAugmented reality glasses and displays available everywhere – from watches to monitor walls\nSoftware, movies, music bought ‘in a box’\nCloud-based content, charge according to frequency of use\nVideo game consoles\nVirtual play worlds which can be entered from any computer system\nManually controlled cars\nIndividualized teaching by intelligent systems, perfectly tailored to students’ individual skills\nWorkers\nRobots\nThe world in 2030\nSo, what will life in the future look like? Augmented reality devices will mostly replace today’s ultra-popular smartphones. Overwhelming progress in directly connecting computer chips and optical nerves will enable blind people to access augmented reality. And the most popular videos in the YouTube of the future will be self-made 3D movies – including unlimited viewing angles and freely focusable depth range. Traditional game consoles will disappear. Instead, virtual universes will be computed by huge computer systems distributed across numerous cities – partly located down in the basements of big apartment buildings to keep transmissions paths as short as possible. It’s a great opportunity, if you can create play worlds which are interesting enough to persuade other players to join up and pay a subscription or joining fee.\nExtremely powerful computers are required for all this. The rule of thumb is: the smaller the transistors in a processor the better the speed. With every further step towards miniaturization, Intel and co. are approaching the limits of what is physically feasible. In the past, though, processor developers have repeatedly demonstrated their creativity, and a massive increase of the core number on every chip could also be an option. At present, the processing performance of computers is expected to double every 18 months, while the price remains the same. This would mean that in 18 years’ time, computers would be four thousand times faster than those of the machines available today. In theory, home computers could be more powerful than that IBM Watson supercomputer (for the techies: 2880 Power7-cores featuring 3.55 GHz each), at a cost comparable to an ordinary laptop today. It would be possible to create the first Toy Story film on a home desktop, in real time and at cinema resolution, and the first-ever complete computer simulation of the simplest known genome Mycoplasma Genitalium, celebrated just a few months ago as a scientific milestone, would be a standard experiment conducted in school classrooms.\nThe quantum computer technology we hear so much about is also expected to have matured by 2030. Considering the present state of knowledge, it won’t be possible to solve every typical computer problem using a handful of quantum bits, but the cracking of strong RSA encryption (applied for instance to provide security for emails and online-banking transactions) could have become reality twenty years from now.\nIt seems certain, however, that rootkits, Trojans and phishing attacks will continue to be serious problems over the coming years, with attackers concentrating more on servers than on devices. This is because more vulnerabilities appear in complex environments and it is reasonable to assume that the operating systems of tablets and smartphones will be “purged” within the next few years and that the bulk of the coding will be shifted into the cloud – and thus onto the server side.\nIt is, of course, not just the financial implications of the computer viruses of the future that are serious. The detection of the sabotage worm known as Stuxnet in 2010 confirmed suspicions that malware could also have a political context. The continuous militarization of cyberspace will produce legions of professional malware authors as the creation of Trojans and the carrying out of web attacks is legitimized and even supported by some states.\nSingularity\nAs suddenly as this trend has emerged, its end may not be far off – humans working to create new security threats could be superseded by machines fighting against machines. This is where the progress of artificial intelligence could be crucial. The magic word is “singularity”, used in future studies to describe the point in time when computers will be sufficiently intelligent to develop independently without human support. It sounds incredible and there is still huge controversy among scientists about when – or indeed if – we will reach this point. I don’t want to bore you and duck the question: my guess is that it will arrive in 10-15 years.\nEven today it is difficult for us to keep pace with the breathtaking speed of new developments. But when singularity is achieved, the pace will accelerate significantly yet again: it’s as if prehistoric man had discovered fire at breakfast, had been catapulted into the Middle Ages by lunch time, witnessed the industrial revolution in the afternoon and then arrived in the computer age by the evening!\nOur minds, as well as our senses, developed over millions of years by the gentle hand of evolution, will be suddenly exposed in one blink of history’s eye to technologies that are generations ahead of our biological development.\nNow, there’s nothing bad about technical aids, though our ancestors certainly took advantage of the illiterate once written language had been invented. In recent years, search engines and services like Wikipedia have pushed information processing forward. But one thing still applies: it is man who holds the ropes, while the computer lends its technical horsepower to the task at hand. If, though, we allow our lives to be entirely optimized through digital assistance systems, that balance of power will be reversed. Every attempt to return control to the human mind will inevitably cause efficiency losses.\nAfter a certain point, intelligent systems could become so superior to us that we would no longer be able to grasp the mechanisms and reasons underlying the advice they gave us. We would resemble infants who trust their mothers blindly because they have no other option. The difference, though, is that a child grows and will, as an adult, finally be able to stand on his or her own feet. Humanity could be dependent on the assistance of computers for the rest of our lives.\nEven if the next few years are relatively calm, we need to start thinking now about how to deal with these developments. How should researchers react to a breakthrough in artificial intelligence? When all is said and done, a highly intelligent system could be abused as a weapon. Developing nuclear devices is forbidden to the average citizen by international treaties – but building an all-powerful intelligence at home will present the creators with no legal problems at all and regulating them will probably be impossible. Let’s just hope that the lucky creator of the first genuine artificial intelligence will not immediately decide to go for world supremacy!\nAnother challenge is how to deal with the truth: we expect computers to be absolutely objective. If a head of state was just told that he is wrong in front of his people and asked if he would kindly resign – would he accept? Or will we force computers to adopt our “truths” against “their” better judgment? In such a world, we would not need antivirus software but psychologists as the compulsory processing of contradictory information can only lead to digital psychosis – remember the film 2001: A Space Odyssey?\nCommon sense\nThe future holds exciting opportunities, but there are also lots of risks and our own weaknesses, in particular, will play a major role. In the 1950s, scientists Peter Milner and James Olds experimented on rats with electrodes implanted in their brains’ “pleasure centers” – if these animals were offered the chance to stimulate themselves at the push of a button they continued doing that until they died of complete exhaustion. On a computer-controlled planet, neither clocking in nor job centers would exist. Everybody would be free to realize his or her own dreams and talents.  Depending on our self-discipline, a world full of artists, athletes and writers might emerge – or, on the contrary, a sad little heap of lethargic couch potatoes!\nWhen I am asked in interviews how people can best protect themselves against Internet threats, I always emphasize – apart from technical solutions – the importance of common sense. And if common sense ever fails, we can only hope at least that the computers will keep cool heads!\nThe biggest opportunities and dangers of our digital future\nTechnology\n","source":"google_52778141428876"}

Many urban centers of our nation need dependable and affordable mass transit systems. ...\nMass transportation offers the prospect for significant energy conservation. ... To encourage existing businesses to remain in urban centers and to attract new businesses to urban areas, it is vital that adequate public and private transportation facilities be provided.\nSound like something Van Jones might have said? Before you peek ahead, see if you know who was behind this bit of bragging.\nHe played a key role in passing the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act. He led the Clean Air Act to passage, a law that fundamentally reformed the previous law and is recognized as one of the most sweeping environmental laws ever enacted. ... As president [he] will continue to support the development of non-polluting electric vehicles and cleaner alternative fuels.\nHang on just a little longer. Before you put a name to this environmental champion, take a look at one more snippet.\nIn some States ... a proportion of highway funds is diverted to other purposes. This must stop. ... It is long past time for the federal government to get out of way and allow private ventures to provide passenger service to the northeast corridor. The same holds true with regard to high-speed and intercity rail across the country.\nIf you think these radically different positions are from different documents, you\u0027re right. If you think they\u0027re from different parties... think again.\nJust as you\u0027ll never be able to hide from that Facebook picture you unwisely posted after the office Christmas party, or pull back that tweet delivered in anger, the Internet acts as a kind of preservative for political positions. No matter how badly parties and politicians might want to hide from statements they\u0027ve made in the past, the web holds them like a fly in... a web.\nBuried in lithologies of links and marked in ages that go past like eye blinks, these fragments of preserved politics allow us to perform a kind of digital archeology. With a search engine for a shovel and no more than patience for a brush, we can dust off lost worlds that some would just as soon stay lost.\nThe quotes at the start of this article come from three artifacts of the web. The first is the 1980 Republican Platform –the platform that Ronald Reagan ran on in route to becoming the ur-conservative. The second clip above, the one that showcases a candidate\u0027s environmental leadership, comes from the 1996 Dole-Kemp campaign site still ticking along on its own server 16 years later. Finally, that last bit is the most recent, still lying there on the fresh surface of the Interwebs. It\u0027s from the 2012 Republican Platform .\nThis past week, David Frum maintained that the problem with the GOP is that it has failed to change in the last thirty years, but the evidence of the documents shows that\u0027s absolutely not true. The GOP has changed–changed from a party that held a few extreme positions, into one that holds nothing but. By looking at issues as the manifestation of a party\u0027s \"genes\", you can trace the line of Republican descent from mainstream to has been.\nImmigration\nWatching the development of the positions is like watching features appear on a growing animal. Not everything happens at once, or in the order you might expect.  On the subject of immigration, the 1980 platform is remarkably mild.\nRepublicans are proud that our people have opened their arms and hearts to strangers from abroad and we favor an immigration and refugee policy which is consistent with this tradition. ... The federal government has a duty to adopt immigration laws and follow enforcement procedures which will fairly and effectively implement the immigration policy desired by the American people.\nWhat that policy may be goes unstated. Republicans seemed willing to leave this decision until after the election, and ultimately Reagan\u0027s policy was to provide \"amnesty for those who have put down roots and lived here, even though sometime back they may have entered illegally.\" By 1996, Bob Dole has already picked up much of the familiar rhetoric that has made Republicans such a hit with immigrant populations.\nBob Dole does not believe that immigrants who have entered the United States illegally should be entitled to government welfare services and other benefits. Bob Dole supports strengthening the Border Patrol and streamlining the deportation process for illegal aliens.\nDole spends another couple of paragraphs hammering President Clinton for being \"soft on illegal immigration\" and for not ceding more control of immigration to the states. His positions is almost perfectly aligned with that of the 2012 platform.\nOur highest priority, therefore, is to secure the rule of law both at our borders and at ports of entry. ... State efforts to reduce illegal immigration must be encouraged, not attacked.\nBetween 1980 and 1996, the Republican Party moved from accepting immigration as a national issue and being open to different solutions, to a position that focused on beefing up border control and shifting immigration issues to the states. Not surprisingly, this move came with a lot of language around the threat posed by immigrants, language that in the 2012 platform associates immigrants with terrorists and drug cartels.\nThe federal budget\nIt might seem a given that conservatives were always in favor of a balanced budget amendment and chopping social programs, but the 1980 platform views the first as optional and the second as unnecessary.\nBy increasing economic growth, tax rate reduction will reduce the need for government spending on unemployment, welfare, and public jobs programs. However, the Republican Party will also halt excessive government spending by eliminating waste, fraud, and duplication. ... We believe a Republican President and a Republican Congress can balance the budget and reduce spending through legislative actions, eliminating the necessity for a Constitutional amendment to compel it.\nGeorge H. W. Bush was right to call Reagan\u0027s plan \"voodoo economics,\" but at least the 1980 plan seems to believe the words of their head houngan. They didn\u0027t demand up front slicing of the social safety net to fund the tax cut, but assumed that the cut would make all other problems moot. That position is somewhat mimicked by Dole. The Dole-Kemp plan is far more focused on tax cuts than the 1980 platform, calling for an across the board 15% cut in income tax rates, and a rollback of adjustments made to keep Social Security solvent. Dole\u0027s plan also called for a no-way-out balanced budget amendment. Much of his plan is dedicated to preaching the benefits of eliminating the federal deficit, but Dole offered nothing in the way of any details on what might be chopped to pay for massive tax cuts. It was a completely voodoo-driven plan. The 2012 platform pushes farther. It calls for not just preserving all the cuts made under Bush, but a 20% across the board cut. It also calls for chopping all corporate taxes, elimination of capital gains tax, the alternative minimum tax and the inheritance tax. The 2012 platform would then impose a balanced budget amendment. Unlike Dole, they don\u0027t pretend that this would generate additional revenue for the government. Starving the government is a goal.\nUnions\nIf you\u0027ve ever wondered why blue-collar workers were swayed to Reagan\u0027s side in the 1980 race, it wasn\u0027t because they\u0027d developed an overnight disdain for unions.\nWe reaffirm our commitment to the fundamental principle of fairness in labor relations, including the legal right of unions to organize workers and to represent them through collective bargaining consistent with state laws and free from unnecessary government involvement. We applaud the mutual efforts of labor and management to improve the quality of work life.\nReagan honed his political skills on the GE payroll making fiery anti-labor speeches, but little of that leaked into the platform. Although there\u0027s one sentence devoted to saying that states should be allowed to pass \"right to work\" laws, the 1980 platform focuses on union workers as the victims of inflation and a bad economy. Dole doesn\u0027t address union issues at all in his 1996 site, but by 2012 unions have been transformed into a prime cause of economic hardship.\nWe will restore the rule of law to labor law by blocking “card check,” enacting the Secret Ballot Protection Act, enforcing the Hobbs Act against labor violence, and passing the Raise Act to allow all workers to receive well-earned raises without the approval of their union representative. We demand an end to the Project Labor Agreements; and we call for repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act, which costs the taxpayers billions of dollars annually in artificially high wages on government projects. ... Ultimately, we support the enactment of a National Right-to-Work law to promote worker freedom and to promote greater economic liberty.\nThis is only scratching the surface of how the GOP has shifted, and I\u0027ll get to other issues in follow-up articles, but each of these three issues shows the pattern that the Republican Party has traced over the last thirty years. Starting from positions that leaned right but made at least a gesture toward tolerance, the party has shifted to uniformly more hardline positions. At the same time, it has elaborated on each of these positions, decorating each with with dozens of new proposed acts and arcane references to laws going back half a century or more. If the 1980 platform proposes a shining bridge to a conservative future, the 2012 version of that bridge is encrusted with barnacles and weighted by hundreds of bizzarre special interests that border on (and sometimes are) conspiracy theory. It\u0027s a narrower, meaner bridge with a less optimistic destination.\nThis tendency toward increasing specialization and elaboration is a pattern often seen in nature. Whether it\u0027s the convoluted chambers in ammonites or the massive antlers of Irish Elk, there are always groups that chart courses toward more specialized requirements and more highly ornamented forms. It\u0027s a tendency that nearly always leads to the same fate: extinction.\nTags\n","source":"google_52778141428876"}

Who needs face time with the people around you when you can email, text or tweet to and from almost anywhere in the world? Twitter, the social networking and microblogging site, is said to have more than 300 million users worldwide who follow, forward and respond to each other’s 140-character tweets about anything and everything, 24/7.\nBut MIT researchers who studied the growth of the newly hatched Twitter from 2006 to 2009 say the site’s growth in the United States actually relied primarily on media attention and traditional social networks based on geographic proximity and socioeconomic similarity. In other words, at least during those early years, birds of a feather flocked — and tweeted — together.\nIn their study of Twitter’s “contagion process,” the researchers looked at data from 16,000 U.S. cities, focusing on the 408 with the highest number of Twitter users and seeking to update traditional models of how information spreads and technology is adopted.\nJust as marketing experts sometimes label consumers as early adopters, early majority adopters, late majority adopters or laggards, the researchers characterized cities in those terms, based on when Twitter accounts in a given city reached critical mass. Critical mass is generally defined as the point when something reaches 13.5 percent of the population, which for this study was 13.5 percent of the highest total number of Twitter users in a city through August 2009, the end of the study period.\nAs with most technologies, the growth in popularity initially spread via young, tech-savvy “innovators,” in this case from Twitter’s birthplace in San Francisco to greater Boston. But the site’s popularity then took a more traditional route of traveling only short distances, implying face-to-face interactions; this approach made early adopters of Somerville, Mass., and Berkeley, Calif. — cities close to Boston and San Francisco, respectively. Twitter use then spread through early majority cities such as Santa Fe and Los Angeles and late majority cities such as Baltimore and Las Vegas before reaching laggards such as Palm Beach, Fla., and Newark, N.J. All these cities ultimately ranked among the 408 nationwide with the largest numbers of Twitter accounts.\n“Even on the Internet where we may think the world is flat, it’s not,” says Marta González, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering and engineering systems at MIT, who is co-author of a paper on this subject appearing this month in the journal PLoS ONE. “The big question for people in industry is ‘How do we find the right person or hub to adopt our new app so that it will go viral?’ But we found that the lone tech-savvy person can’t do it; this also requires word of mouth. The social network needs geographical proximity. … In the U.S. anyway, space and similarity matter.”\nEach circle represents a U.S. city containing Twitter users. As time goes on, circles grow in size as more users sign up in that location. When a location has reached a \u0027critical mass\u0027 of users, or 13.5 percent of all eventual users have signed up, the location turns red. The line being drawn across the center of the screen is a time series of the number of new users that signed up across the whole country in a given week.\nVideo: Jameson Toole\nFor nearly 50 years, marketers have studied the “diffusion of innovations” (named by Everett Rogers in his 1962 book of the same title) to predict how the purchase of expensive, durable goods such as cars and refrigerators will spread. But the diffusion of high-tech websites and cheap smartphone apps is thought to occur in a very different way.\n“Nobody has ever really looked at the diffusion among innovators of a no-risk, free or low-cost product that’s only useful if other people join you. It’s a new paradigm in economics: what to do with all these new things that are free and easy to share,” says MIT graduate student Jameson Toole, a co-author of the paper.\nMeeyoung Cha of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology is the third co-author, and also the person who had the prescience to begin downloading Twitter-published user data (via Twitter API) in May 2006, when there were only a couple of hundred users. She downloaded data through August 2009, when user growth dropped off for a time.\nGonzález and Toole said their model of Twitter contagion didn’t fit Cha’s data until they added media influence, based on the number of news stories appearing weekly in Google News searches, data they acquired using Google Insights for Search, which provides historical search-engine data.\n“Other studies have included news media in their models, but usually as a constant,” González says. “We saw that news media is not a constant. Instead, it’s media responding to people’s interest and vice versa, so we included it as random spikes.”\nThe study data include the growth spike that began April 15, 2009, when actor Ashton Kutcher challenged CNN to see who could first attract 1 million Twitter followers. Kutcher ultimately won, reaching the million mark in the wee hours of April 17, about half an hour before CNN. Popular talk-show host Oprah Winfrey invited Kutcher to appear on her show that same day; when she ceremoniously sent her first tweet, the pace of new news stories picked up again, and so did new Twitter accounts.\nThe Twitter bird was suddenly on all the wires, and Twitter’s user accounts increased fourfold because of the media attention, indicating that as recently as 2009, location-based social networks and media attention still held sway over computer-based social networks.\n“This analysis brings together different dimensions of diffusion and  product adoption: geography, media coverage and social networks,” says  social network scholar David Lazar, an associate professor in  Northeastern University’s Department of Political Science and the  College of Computer and Information Science. “There are few examples of  research that have all three of those pieces. Pulling it all into one  analysis using novel sources of data — Twitter adoption by metropolitan  area and Google search terms — is really a nice innovation.”\n","source":"google_52778141428876"}

Photograph: PA\n2.10pm: Well, it seems like a short journey from the Royal Courts of Justice to Parliament. Some of the star witnesses in the Leveson inquiry â€“ Hugh Grant, Steve Coogan and Max Mosley â€“ are appearing before a joint committee of the Commons and the Lords to talk about privacy and gagging injunctions from 2.15pm.\nIt is not at all clear if we will hear anything new â€“ although at least Zac Goldsmith, the Conservative MP, who admitted to having used a privacy injunction, is also in the mix. Goldsmith, unlike the other three, did not appear in front of Lord Justice Leveson. A little while after that a group of regulators and self-regulators, including Ofcom and the PCC will appear.\nNow that Leveson has begun, the parliamentary inquiry, also set up by David Cameron at the height of the superinjunctions \"crisis\", appears superfluous. But MPs and peers don\u0027t like being ignored, so no doubt there will be a little theatre, and perhaps also some insight too.\nAt the Leveson inquiry itself, two former staff of the information commissioner\u0027s office were giving evidence this morning. Here are the key points of what they said:\nâ€¢ The information commissioner\u0027s office (ICO) was advised by counsel in 2003 that Steve Whittamore\u0027s seized files showed that journalists had committed offences and that \"several editors must have been aware\" of it.\nâ€¢ Francis Aldhouse, former deputy information commissioner, says it was not his view that the press was \"too big to take on\" and that journalists should have been investigated.\nYou can read a full account of their evidence in our live blog .\n2.22pm: While we are waiting for the action, here\u0027s some background reading in the form of the witness statements provided to the Leveson Inquiry by three of the witnessess.\nHugh Grant -\nMax Mosley meanwhile is over here\nHappy reading...\n2.25pm: And they line up, all sober suits and ties. Unsure who looks smarter...\n2.26pm: Coogan opens. Complains that us \"on the other side\" of press reports don\u0027t \"have that platform\" to respond to their critics. Says intrusions into his privacy down the years are \"nothing remarkable, perfunctory\". He\u0027s smiling though. \"Use of the term celebrity,\" Coogan notes is seen as a derogatory term, but adds that \"we are more comfortable with public speaking than some of the less well known and more deserving victims\" of press intrusion.\n2.28pm: Grant next. \"I\u0027ve never denied that I am cross,\" with intrusions into his privacy. But complains about intrusions of girlfriends and other relations was \"all in the name of profit\" and that means his anger his \"doubled\". Grant repeats Coogan\u0027s mantra about and adds that he is here \"for the country, if that doesn\u0027t sound too pompous\".\n2.30pm: Max Mosley begins noting that only the wealthy can bring proceedings for defamation. \"It\u0027s very comparable to burgarly, breach of privacy,\" Mosley argues repeating an argument he has made several times before. \"We need a much cheaper body,\" to sort out cases of defamation he says, then argues again for the need for \"prior notification\" of breaches of privacy.\n2.32pm: Zac Goldsmith reminds us he once edited the Ecologist magazine before referring to his injuunction. \"Very briefly, I discovered that a great many emails between my sister and my ex wife had been illegally distributed\" to newspapers . Said he had achieved an \"interim superinjunction\" to prevent anybody using those emails in news stories; later the injunction was later varied so he could be named. He said the emails had gone to \"the Sun, the News of the World, to the Mail Group, to many others\". Worried that it would have got out without him even knowing who was behind it. Goldsmith says the day following that journalists were \"shouting to him over his garden wall - is it true you are divorcing your wife?\" The emails did not contain any great revelations, but did discuss the impending break with his then wife.\n2.36pm: Despite all the famous names there is no coverage on the BBC News or Sky News. It\u0027s all about the German Chancellor and the French President\n2.37pm: Mosley says that breaching somebody\u0027s privacy is \"desparately important\" for the person who is the subject of the story. It should not be done by a newspaper in isolation.\nGoldsmith adds that \"any marginal decision\" should be \"taken by an independent body\" - that is independent of newspapers.\n2.40pm: Grant talks about two newspaper industries. One which is \"great\" whose editors he would trust to take a decision on the public interest; a second which is based on the appropriation by \"criminal means of another person\u0027s privacy for profit\". Grant now supports Nick Davies\u0027s suggestion that a newspaper could apply to an independent arbitrator to give them guidance as to whether publication of certain facts or news items can be justified.\n2.40pm: Looks like we are going to get four answers to every question. Coogan defends regulation of broadcasters and said that BBC can undertake investigative journalism even though it is regulated by the likes of Ofcom.\n2.41pm: Hugh Grant\u0027s collar is markedly out of place. Somebody needs to do a style analysis here.\n2.42pm: Lord Harris asks if it would help if there was a \"statutory definition of the public interest\". Mosley sees arguments both ways, but adds \"there probably is a need for some sort of definition coming from parliament\" because there is an \"argument to increase protection for press when there is a strong public interest\".\n2.43pm: Hugh Grant does not support a privacy law, in a short answer to Ben Bradshaw MP. Mosley, again, says \"there is not really a great deal wrong\" with the existing law, other than a need \"for more protection for the press and prior notification\". But he adds \"the real problem is enforcement\" - indicating he believes that the PCC is too weak.\n2.45pm: George Eustice MP says he is attracted to the \"idea of prior notification\". Mosley says you can adopt the wording of S12.2 of the Human Rights Act - which says you have to take \"all reasonable steps\" to notify a subject. Mosley says that celebrities would only need 24 hours because they have the right lawyers, but people in the street might need 48 to 72 hours. (How would Sunday newspapers operate in that environment, one has to ask.)\n2.47pm: Goldsmith again repeats there is a need to reform the costs of bringing defamation and privacy actions. Mosley, who is doing most of the speaking here, says \"tough fines after the event would only work if they were so big\" that newspapers would not dare breach privacy in advance.\n2.48pm: The Leveson Inquiry has finished for the day. If you missed it, our live blog is here .\n2.49pm: Coogan speaks up for the need for newspapers to publish front page apologies, but Mosley says that wouldn\u0027t have helped in his case. Privacy is different he says. If the News of the World had printed \"it was a private orgy\" on its front page, he says, then \"that wouldn\u0027t have helped me\". There is some laughter.\n2.51pm: Hugh Grant says he wished his lawyer could explain about the \"procedures he went through\" to stop papparazi \"torturing a grown woman and her child\" as they harassed the mother of his daugther and her family. Repeats story that the PCC failed to eliminate the photographers outside her home - it only reduced their amount by \"about 30%\". At Coogan\u0027s prompting, Grant adds that for many years it was not worth ringing up the police \"for a burglary or mugging or anything because very often the first person who would call up is a reporter\".\n2.53pm: \"We\u0027re not the kind of people who are photographed in our living rooms for OK! magazine,\" says Coogan. But he says that even people that do, don\u0027t get sign up to have their \"door broken into by Hello magazine\". You don\u0027t forfeit all your privacy by giving interviews.\n2.55pm: John Whittingdale asks, tactlessly, about Divine Brown. Grant says that matter was \"criminal, no a misdemeanour. That was on the public record, I expected to be reported, I had no beef.\"\n2.56pm: Goldsmith says that we need to \"tread a fine line\" between a free press and any restriction. Coogan quotes Lord Shawcross in 1962, saying that the peer then said that \"the press should be given another opportunity\" to reform itself before laws are introduced. We have been here before, he says. Coogan recalls that he was \"talking with Simon Jenkins\" about this last week (there was a lively exchange with the former Times editor and Guardian columnist on Radio 4 I recall) - and Coogan says that Jenkins says that the press calms down for a while and then behaves badly again.\n2.59pm: Coogan says a reformed PCC \"need to have a press element\" so that they can \"put their side\", but wants a beefed up independent side. Baroness Bonham-Carter, queries whether the \"law is too big a weapon\" and asks if that would hinder newspapers like the Guardian. Grant replies that the Guardian has \"never had a privacy case against it\" but says that this newspaper would like to see libel law reformed.\n3.01pm: Paul Waugh tweets that we are not learning anything new here:\nI wonder how many of the Joint Cttee on Privacy and Injunctions actually watched Leveson? This session feels like a BBC repeat.\n3.02pm: Hugh Grant asks if the Sun made Four Weddings a success. He says \"the hubris is demented\" because a British tabloid could not have made the film successful in Venezuela and some other countries I missed.\n3.04pm: Mosley says that there should be a distinction between the body that \"makes the rules\" for the press and the body that enforces them. It was a point he was \"dying to make\".\n3.05pm: Hugh Grant says \"I wasn\u0027t even aware that I had a good name\" and says it has nothing to do with whether a film he is in succeeds. Conversely he says \"Tom Hanks has a great name; he is a great family man. But he is still capable of making films that are flops.\"\n3.06pm: Max Mosley says footballers are not role models in the bedroom. Tabloids should be obliged show evidence that \"people would not have bought the [football] shirts\" if they had known the footballer was a philanderer or what have you. (No idea how a tabloid would prove that, but it is what he suggested.)\nCoogan then tries to say something about the Rio Ferdinand v Sunday Mirror case, but Mosley interrupts him, noting that the footballer is \"going to appeal\".\n3.09pm: Goldsmith argues that in the case of an MP who lies about his or her private life, that there is a case for breaching somebody\u0027s privacy. The role model argument, in effect, applies. \"There are a lot of complaints that judges are getting out of control; I do believe that they are behaving responsibly,\" he says. But to deal with growing criticism of judges in privacy cases, Goldsmith says parliament should legislate anyway.\n3.12pm: Here\u0027s a picture of Coogan giving evidence:\nSteve Coogan is taking this seriously\n3.14pm: Lord Black of Brentwood says that a free press needs to be \"commercially successful\". Important this, given his role at the Telegraph Media Group and on the PCC. \"Do you think, when a court is taking a judge of the public interest, it needs to take account of the commercial viability of newspapers?\" Coogan jumps in and says \"absolutely not\", while Mosley gives a longer answer. Then Goldsmith says there is no excuse if a business breaks the law: \"Nobody is saying Auschwitz should have been kept open; it created jobs.\"\n3.17pm: Coogan says that there are plenty of people \"interested in asylum seekers and house prices that would continue to buy the Daily Mail\" without the \"tawdry\" intrusions into privacy. He attacks Dacre again...what would Alan Partridge say?\n3.18pm: Mosley says he has spent \"well over Â£500,000\" getting references to the \"Nazi orgy\" story off various websites, including getting references to it taken down from 192 sites in Germany.\n3.20pm: Here\u0027a a picture of Grant giving evidence:\nFour Weddings Actor in full flow\n3.20pm: Coogan says he has spent more than Â£200,000 on his phone-hacking case against the News of the World â€“ an amount of money that he says \"keeps me awake at night\".\n3.21pm: Mosley repeats that he got Â£60,000 in damages from the News of the World and 82% of his costs from the News of the World. So he was Â£30,000 out of pocket and \"the judge can\u0027t even remove it from the public mind\". Repeating his key point, Mosley says that is the justification for prior notification.\n3.23pm: Grant leans sideways in the committee room chair, while he waits for a question. They are being asked about harassment by photographers. Grant says there is \"always arguing with them, or failing that violence, which I\u0027ve tried once or twice\". He says that he has \"had my car Stanley knifed in retribution\" after he complained about a photographer\u0027s conduct. Says that freelance photographers \"are often recruited from the criminal classes\" â€“ a point echoed by Coogan. Grant repeats that he had take out an injunction to protect Ting Lan Hong and says \"I can\u0027t believe how well my one worked.\" Mosley adds that most people can\u0027t afford an injunction.\n3.27pm: Grant: \"I would argue there is a sifgnificant privacy gap between what is put on a blog or a tweet and a newspaper.\" Says it matters less to him because blogs don\u0027t profit from invading privacy, by and large. But he says that newspapers \"launder the story\" by allowing news they can\u0027t print to \"leak into the blogosphere\".\n3.29pm: Zac Goldsmith\u0027s line comparing red tops to a Nazi death camp is doing the rounds on Twitter. Here\u0027s Times columnist Janice Turner on the subject:\nZac Goldsmith compares tabloids to Auschwitz. Tom Watson \u0026 Steve Coogan compared them to mafia. And it\u0027s newspapers who are sensationalist?\n3.30pm: Mosley says that pictures from the orgy video taken by the News of the World can still be found on Google. He says that whenever \"people meet you, they Google you\" and the images can still be seen. He cannot escape the News of the World story, he says, even though he won damages in court. Says search engines should be obliged to take down news items, images that are found to be in breach of privacy.\n3.32pm: None of this is trending on Twitter.\n3.33pm: Grant says he is a \"technical moron\" before saying that the internet should be covered by the same defamation and privacy laws. Goldsmith says there is a \"wonderful piece\" online that links his green work to \"a Colombian drugs cartel\" but that it only matters if \"the person who is saying it has a big enough platform\" and that includes a respected blogger such as Iain Dale.\n3.35pm: Hugh Grant says his experience of the PCC is negative; repeats his year-long battle with the Mirror in the mid-1990s and says that he never used the PCC knowingly since. The apology was tiny and did not explain the original errorÂ â€“ although his lawyer once tried without his knowing.\n\"When I see people like Paul Dacre in the PCC, that doesn\u0027t fill me with huge confidence,\" says Coogan.\nGoldsmith says he went to the PCC and got an apology from the Sunday Times for an incorrect allegation that he â€“ along with Saif Gaddafi â€“ avoided paying stamp duty. Goldsmith says that he didn\u0027t; and that he couldn\u0027t. \"Time to create a properly independent organisation that has the teeth and the stamina to act as an independent regulator,\" he adds.\nLink to that Sunday Times PCC ruling is here .\n3.40pm: Lord Thomas asks who should pay for this prior notification/defamation/privacy adviser that all the witnesses are advocating. Mosley says that there should be a levy on newspapers of \"less than 1p per copy sold per day\" and be funded by fines. Grant says that \"in Max\u0027s system\" smaller newspapers would also have a chance to defend themselves because the costs of this new body would be much smaller.\nMosley says \"we are going to make a proposal to the Leveson inquiry\" along these lines. That\u0027s interesting.\n3.43pm: Hugh Grant goes back to the \"business of laundering stories\" as a way of going around the arbitrator. \"All they have to do is slip it to a magazine in America,\" says Grant - appearing to refer to the fact that the story about his fatherhood first broke in US Weekly. Wonder what the US magazine has to say about its sources?\n3.45pm: Remember that Grant told Leveson that the Mail were onto the story about his paternity for some time. The Mail didn\u0027t publish, and the story about Ting Lan Hong emerged in US Weekly instead. He said at Leveson that he had \"no idea\" how the fatherhood story emerged in the American title.\n3.47pm: Mosley said it was his \"duty\" to sue the News of the World.\nCoogan says if \"the Daily Mail is attacking you, it is a good sign that you are on the right track\". He adds: \"When I started legal action against News International that it was a very lonely place to be; there was no bandwagon, although I was looking for one.\" He was advised by his PR advisers that there would be a benefit to dropping the legal action against News.\nGrant then asks Coogan to say who his PR advisers are. Coogan says it\u0027s \"Freud Communications,\" who Grant describes as \"News International\u0027s little helpers\". Coogan, though, isn\u0027t so sure, and this curious exchange ends: \"It\u0027s a little more complicated than that.\"\nYou\u0027ll recall that Matthew Freud of Freud PR firm got into a dispute with Grant involving some chocolate cake at an event a few years ago. Coogan clearly hasn\u0027t.\n3.52pm: And that\u0027s it for the famous four. Regulators time now.\n3.53pm: Here are the witnesses:\nStephen Abell, director, Press Complaints Commission\nEd Richards, chief executive, Ofcom\nTony Close, director of standards, Ofcom\nPete Johnson, chief executive, Authority for Television On Demand (ATVOD)\n3.54pm: \"How many privacy complaints do you have?\" asks Gisela Stuart.\nThe PCC recieves about 500-600 cases relating to privacy a year; about 180-200 are in breach of the code. \"So about two in five of the cases come to sort of remedy\", says Stephen Abell.\n3.55pm: This looks fun â€“ from Paul Waugh\u0027s Twitter feed:\nJulian Assange is outside the Privacy Cttee, chatting to Zac Goldsmith.\n3.56pm: Lord Boateng asks if PCC has to power to fine or enforce compensation would make a difference. \"If you are actively seeking a monetary compensation, it is more straightforward to seek that through the libel courts,\" says Abell. However, he says many complainants are not looking for money and that the PCC can be quick.\nLord Thomas jumps in and says that it can take a year for complaints to be resolved. \"If you look generally, we average all complaints in 32 days, that\u0027s actually pretty swift,\" says Abell.\nBradshaw brings up example of PCC\u0027s failure to get photographers to leave Ting Lan Hong alone. \"How do you regulate people with no discernible set of standards?\" says Abell. You only need \"a scooter and an iPhone\" to become a paparazzo.\n4.00pm: \"We did offer a service to Mr Grant,\" says Abell. \"It had a limited effect, he went for an injunction quite rightly.\" He says PCC role was, in this case, part of a patchwork of jurisidictions that got a result in the case of Ting Lan Hong.\n4.01pm: Abell says that complainants regard prominence of an apology as important; so does the PCC, he says. \"If you complain about an article on page 6 of a newspaper, you are very likely to get an apology of page 6.\" Doesn\u0027t say anything about page 1.\n4.02pm: Whittingdale says it is not a question of what page an apology appears on, rather it is the size of the apology. He adds that complicating the picture further is the emergence of corrections columns â€“ that is where newspapers want to put apologies. \"I think it needs to be wrestled with further...the notion that you come to the PCC and if you get a correction or apology it gets buried on page 34, that isn\u0027t true.\"\nEd Richards adds as per Ofcom and TV: \"In our regime we can dictate the terms of a correction.\"\n4.05pm: Ofcom model breaks down for press because, Abell says, there is no licensing for newspapers. Radio spectrum is scarce; the press has a different history. Abell says that newspaper licensing would be \"undesirable and impractical in philosophical terms\". Abell adds that the \"notion of fines is something that can be explored further\", but stopping editions is not a viable sanction.\n4.07pm: Abell says that defining public interest and privacy is difficult in law. \"Both in areas of privacy law generally and public interest law specifically, there is a difficult in trying to codify something,\" Abell adds.\n4.09pm: Ed Richards, from Ofcom, says legal definitions would \"be good for certainty\" but not good for flexibility. Says if parliament defined public interest would be useful to absorb into broadcasting code, but adds \"it would be probably unwise to make that exhaustive\". Richards can imagine that cases not considered by law makers could crop up.\n4.11pm: Richards says there is a public interest in privacy and freedom of expression. Says he would see both rights as \"in balance\".\nGeorge Eustice asks if public interest test should be same for broadcasters and newspapers. Richards says that \"in principle the answer to that must be yes\". The list of possible areas include \"accountablity for those in power\" and \"health and safety\". Others are listed in the broadcasting code. And Ofcom looks at backdrop of case law.\n4.13pm: The committee room has cleared out now that there are professional experts in the room giving evidence.\n4.14pm: Abell says PCC has to start with \"premise that everybody has the right to a private life\" and that you have to test whether there is a right to breaking it.\nAbell is asked if he is free to get on with his job. Says there are 17 commissioners, seven of whom are editors. Editors are not allowed to sit in judgement on cases affecting their title or any titles in their groups. Lay members are appointed by a nominations committee of the PCC; details are all on the PCC\u0027s website.\n4.18pm: Abell says that there is a problem because some people can opt out of PCC. He says that the PCC has to work on a \"better incentive system\" to ensure that there are no Nothern \u0026 Shell opt outs. Abell says that although Private Eye is not a member of the PCC, he does not see that a great problem, partly because Private Eye is \"a satirical magazine\". But concedes it is a problem that \"a major newspaper publisher\" â€“ ie Richard Desmond â€“ is outside the system.\n4.21pm: Abell says that a revised PCC ought to have \"a standards arm\". He says \"at the moment the PCC is primarily a complaints-handling organisation\". It also \"contacts people at the centre of news stories to see if they wish to make a complaint\". However, \"there are general concerns about the press where the person doesn\u0027t come to us\". So a standards arm could \"pick things up where there aren\u0027t formal complaint\".\n4.22pm: Abell says that PCC is now trying to learn from Chris Jefferies as to how a restructured PCC might work. Jefferies, Leveson aficionados will remember, said that he had made some suggestions to the PCC but had not received a reply. It looks like the PCC, stung by that, is indicating how seriously it wants to take the man who was caught up in the Joanna Yeates murder at the end of 2010 and beginning of 2011.\n4.27pm: Zac Goldsmith is retreating from his Auschwitz comparison. He is responding to tweets from James Chapman, the Daily Mail\u0027s political editor.\n@jameschappers No one can genuinely believe I equated tabloids to concentration camps. Silly.\nand\n@jameschappers Perhaps. The point is valid, but I could/ shd have made it citing something different.\n4.30pm: Ofcom has had 10 privacy breaches of the code so far this year. Ed Richards says he is not \"overly concerned about body of harm\" because we only intervene after broadcasting, and because \"I am confident our sanctions regime works\". So he says \"broadcasters think very long and hard about breaches of the codes, and in the knowledge that our sanctions regime is effective. That allows us to step back\". Richards reckons that gives broadcasters \"freedom of expression\".\nWhy doesn\u0027t it work for newspapers then? Or does it?\n4.34pm: Stephen Abell says that \"we probably get one a day where an editor calls the PCC for advice\", but the decision to publish is \"not determinative\". In other words it doesn\u0027t count in mitigation. Abell says that PCC is available at 8pm if needed, but that the body is reluctant to give publications \"a green light\" for obvious reasons.\n4.36pm: Abell says that PCC gets pre-publication calls from editors, managing editors or lawyers. But not always editors.\n4.37pm: Stephen Abell from the PCC says \"the status quo is not an option\" for the body. He adds: \"I start from absolute position that what there is needs to be reformed, amended...\"\n4.39pm: Lord Dobbs asks if what Abell describes as \"peer review\" works. Could Richard Desmond ever sit in judgment of Paul Dacre or vice versa? Abell says there is a need for \"a certain amount of expertise\". Dobbs says \"it is not exactly brain surgery\". Well, they do say journalism is a trade.\n4.42pm: Abell is on a long admission of failure when it comes to phone hacking. The PCC has apologised before, but its position is easier now that the organisation has changed its chairman from Baroness Buscombe to Lord Hunt.\nBen Bradshaw says: \"I don\u0027t think we\u0027ve had any evidence apart from the PCC and some journalists defending the PCC\". By contrast, he adds, broadcasters don\u0027t complain about Ofcom.\nAbell says there are people who have \"a positive experience of complaints to the PCC\". But he acknowledges that \"there is a concern about the conduct of journalists in certain areas, particularly in privacy\".\n4.46pm: Abell says, in answer to a question from a bishop, that the press is a \"ludicriously diverse church\". Bishop argues that the church is broader. Laughter.\nPCC says it has to deal with different sets of issues. But adds that his body can be helpful to a broadsheet dealing with celebrity issues, because they deal with privacy far less often.\n4.51pm: Lord Dobbs mentions Piers Morgan. Cites a passage from his diaries, where he wrote \"there was a bit of a PCC issue; I didn\u0027t have time for it and slammed the phone down\". Dobbs says that Morgan wrote that he got the PCC apology watered down. Abell moves onto another topic â€“ in which a tabloid/mid-market paper dropped a story about a family member of somebody famous with a criminal record. That, he argues, is an example of the PCC at work.\n4.54pm: Abell notes in an exchange with a hostile Eric Joyce MP that nobody complained to the PCC about phone hacking - why would they because it was not obvious it was going on at the time. Abell says that is an example of a \"structural deficit\" in the organisation; in other words he is arguing that the PCC needs some kind of standards body or unit to undertake broader inquiries than those raised by complaints.\n4.59pm: Abell: \"Phone hacking and the concerns it raised created a seismic moment\" for the PCC. \"I don\u0027t think this is about saving the PCC, but about saving the [good] work.\"\nWith that, the committee hearing ends for the day.\n5.03pm: Well, who knows what anybody learned from that? Max Mosley talked the most. Hugh Grant looked like he had put his tie on at the last minute. Everybody repeated what they had said to the Leveson inquiry. But, what was interesting was how united Grant, Mosely, Coogan and Goldsmith were. They are all arguing for libel and privacy law reform to bring down the costs of litigation; they were arguing for some sort of special body to deal with complaints; and a requirement for pre-notification when it comes to privacy stories. The group has clearly co-ordinated its evidence: a celebrity alliance, if you like, against a perception of tabloid excess.\n5.20pm: Right, here\u0027s a summary of play:\nâ€¢ Zac Goldsmith courted controversy by comparing tabloid newspapers to concentration camps. He told the parliamentary committe that there is no excuse if a business breaks the law: \"Nobody is saying Auschwitz should have been kept open; it created jobs.\"\nâ€¢ He later partly retracted, writing on Twitter, that his point \"is valid\" but he should have made the comparision to something else. Goldsmith was asked whether the financial situation of a newspaper should be taken into consideration when dealing with complaints.\nâ€¢ Max Mosley revealed that the four famous names, no doubt with others, plan to make a joint submission to the Leveson inquiry into press reform. All four witnesses argued that there should be a body, separate from the PCC, that could advise newspapers on defamation and privacy â€“ and that could adjudicate far more cheaply that the courts.\nâ€¢ Steve Coogan said he has spent Â£200,000 on his phone-hacking case against the News of the World, a sum of money that he said \"keeps me awake at night\".\n","source":"google_52778141428876"}

Like the UK BBC, the ABC has an appalling record of remorseless lying by omission and lying by commission. The extent of this travesty by the ABC can be readily assessed by using the ABC Search Engine that enables one to ï¿½search the entire ABC siteï¿½ for patent falsehoods that the ABC promulgates and for horrendous truths that it refuses to report. The most appalling Awful Truth that the ABC refuses to report is horrendous global infant mortality and in particular infant mortality in countries subject to invasion and occupation by the US Alliance.\nï¿½Under-5 infant deathsï¿½ is a crucial parameter for assessing the consequences of political actions. The UN Population Division (see: http://esa.un.org/wpp/unpp/panel_population.htm ) and  UNICEF  (see: http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/ ) provide regularly updated estimates of  ï¿½under-5 infant deaths\u0027 for every country in the World ï¿½ the Awful Truth is just a few mouse-clicks away. ï¿½Under-5 infant deathsï¿½ are about 0.7 of avoidable deaths from deprivation and deprivation-exacerbated disease in impoverished Developing Countries  and accordingly  if you know the annual ï¿½under-5 infant deathsï¿½ in a country such as US Alliance-occupied Afghanistan (currently 237,000 per year ) one can readily estimate annual avoidable deaths (currently 237,000 per year /0.7 \u003d 339,000 per year in Occupied Afghanistan and roughly 3.4 million over 10 years). In 2003 global avoidable mortality  on Spaceship Earth with the US in charge of the flight deck totalled 16.0 million and under-5 infant deaths totalled 10.6 million  (see my book ï¿½Body Count. Global avoidable mortality since 1950ï¿½: http://globalavoidablemortality.blogspot.com/2008/08/body-count-global-avoidable-mortality.html ).  It is estimated from expert climate scientist assessments that 6 billion under-5 year old infants will die avoidably this century due to unaddressed man-made global warming (see ï¿½Climate Genocideï¿½: https://sites.google.com/site/climategenocide/ ).\nThe Ruler is responsible for the Ruled.  Thus under dictator Gaddafi Libya enjoyed the lowest under-5 infant mortality in Africa (18 deaths per 1,000 live births was compared to 8 in the US) whereas under US Alliance occupation the under-5 infant mortality in Occupied Afghanistan is 199 deaths per 1,000 live births (see WHO: http://www.who.int/countries/en/ ). On this basis the corrupt, racist and genocide-complicit International Criminal Court (ICC) should have demanded arraignment before the ICC of Barack Obama and his US Alliance associates, notably George Bush I, Bill Clinton and George Bush II (US), Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and  David Cameron (UK), Nicolas Sarkozy (France), Angela Merkel (Germany), Stephen Harper (Canada),  John Howard, Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard (Australia) and John Key (New Zealand).  \nHolocaust involves the untimely deaths of huge numbers of people but genocide is defined by Article 2 of the UN Genocide Convention thus:  ï¿½In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: (a) Killing members of the group; (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group ï¿½ (see: https://sites.google.com/site/muslimholocaustmuslimgenocide/un-genocide-convention ).  \nThe UN Genocide Convention demands prosecution of all those complicit in genocide. Further, Article 55 and 56 of the Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War demands that at Occupier must provide life-sustaining food and medical services ï¿½to the fullest extent of the means available to itï¿½. The US Alliance is clearly grossly violating the UN Genocide Convention and the Geneva Convention in Occupied Afghanistan as evidenced by horrendous post-invasion avoidable deaths (4.2 million) and post-invasion under-5 infant deaths (2.9 million, 90% avoidable and due to US alliance war crimes).\nHowever the US Alliance is violently occupying other countries and the post-invasion under-5 infant deaths now total 2.0 million (Iraq, 1990-2011), 2.9 million (Afghanistan, 2001-2011), 1.3 million (Somalia, 1992-2011), 0.2 million (Palestine, 1967-2011)  and 0.2 million (Haiti, 2004-2011), this carnage totalling 6.6 million under-5 infant deaths, with 90% (about 6 million) being avoidable and due to war-maker war crimes. These estimates correspond to total  avoidable deaths from deprivation of 2.9 million ( Iraq ), 4.2 million ( Afghanistan ), 1.8 million ( Somalia ), 0.3 million ( Palestine ) and 0.2 million ( Haiti ). By way of comparison, estimated violent deaths total 1.7 million ( Iraq ), 1.4 million ( Afghanistan ) and 0.4 million ( Somalia ) (see ï¿½Muslim Holocaust, Muslim Genocideï¿½: https://sites.google.com/site/muslimholocaustmuslimgenocide/ ).\nYet this carnage goes essentially unreported by the Western Mainstream media , including Australia \u0027s taxpayer-funded ABC. Thus a search of ï¿½the entire ABC siteï¿½ for the term ï¿½under-5 infant deathsï¿½ yields only 3 results linking to only 2 items, and both of them due to me (see: http://search.abc.net.au/search/search.cgi?query\u003d%22under-5+infant+deaths%22\u0026sort\u003d\u0026collection\u003dabcall_meta\u0026form\u003dsimple ).  \nItem #1 was a broadcast talk I gave on the ABC Radio National Ockham\u0027s Razor program in 2005 about the horrendous civilian deaths associated  with the Iraq War  (Gideon Polya,  ï¿½Australian complicity in Iraq mass mortalityï¿½, ABC Radio National Ockham\u0027s Razor, 28 August 2005: http://www.abc.net.au/rn/ockhamsrazor/stories/2005/1445960.htm  ). This talk was later published as chapter entitled  Gideon Polya, ï¿½Australian complicity in Iraq mass mortalityï¿½, in Robyn Williams (editor), ï¿½Lies, Deep Fries \u0026 Statisticsï¿½, ABC Books, 2007, pp97-103: http://shop.abc.net.au/products/lies-deep-fries-and-statistics .\nSome key quotes relevant to ï¿½under-5 infant deathsï¿½: ï¿½To reiterate, history ignored yields history repeated, but unfortunately lying by omission is entrenched in Anglo-American mainstream media. I have been researching and writing a book on post-1950 avoidable global mortality. This has involved using United Nations data to calculate the avoidable mortality, (or technically, excess mortality) for every country in the world since 1950. Avoidable mortality is the difference between the actual deaths in a country and the deaths expected for a peaceful, decently-run country with the same demographics. The post-1950 avoidable mortality has been 1.3 billion for the world, 1 billion for the Third World and 0.5 billion for the Muslim World, a Muslim Holocaust 100 times greater than the Jewish Holocaust or the contemporaneous but \u0027forgotten\u0027 Bengal Famine in British-ruled India. These figures are horrendous and demand some kind of corroboration. To achieve this I have independently calculated the post-1950 under-5 infant mortality for every country in the world. The post-1950 under-5 infant mortality has totalled about 0.9 billion for the world, 0.8 billion for the non-European world and 0.4 billion for the Muslim world. One can calculate from United Nations demographic data that about 90% of the non-European under-5 infant mortality has been potentially avoidable. When considered country by country, the horrendous post-1950 \u0027avoidable mortality\u0027 and \u0027under-5 infant mortality\u0027 correlate with impositions of First World countries (principally the UK, US, France, Portugal and Russia) that have variously included colonial occupation, neo-colonial hegemony, economic exclusion, economic constraint, malignant interference, corrupt client regimes, militarisation, debt, civil war and international warï¿½\nThe latest UNICEF report in 2005 estimates that for the year 2003 the under-5 infant mortality was 110,000 in occupied Iraq, 292,000 in occupied Afghanistan and 1,000 in the invading and occupying country Australia (noting that these countries have populations of about 25-million, 24-million and 20-million respectively). Using publicly available United Nations and medical literature data one can readily calculate that there have been about 0.4 million avoidable deaths in post-invasion Iraq ï¿½\nThe US, UK and Australia are clearly complicit in horrendous avoidable mortality and infant mortality in a swathe of invaded Asian countries in the post-1950 era. This now raises the philosophic issue of responsibility. The occupying ruler is responsible for the ruled, (noting \u0027occupation\u0027 includes military, economic and political hegemony and rule by client indigenous regimes). Further, whether an adult or child is killed violently or dies non-violently from deprivation or avoidable disease, the end result is the same and the culpability the same. In 2004 the estimated per capita medical expenditure was only $US37 in occupied Iraq , but $US3,100 in the invading and occupying country, Australia . This roughly one-hundredfold difference in per capita medical expenditure is reflected in a one-hundredfold difference in under-5 infant mortality. The provision of grossly inappropriate medical assistance in occupied Iraq at only about 1% of the per capita level in the occupying Coalition countries is criminal and genocidalï¿½\nJihadist violence has taken roughly about 5,000 Western civilian lives over the last 20 years, with most of the victims dying on 9/11 (about 3,000) and the remainder including murdered Israeli civilians and the victims of atrocities such as Madrid , Lockerbie and Bali . However this jihadist violence has had immensely bloodier consequences through the hysterically and dishonestly promoted War on Terror that has been associated with post-invasion avoidable deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan alone that total 1.6 million. The War on Terror has substantially helped to produce a post-9/11 extra profit for the US military-industrial complex of about $US500 billion. The annual world death toll from car accidents and smoking-related causes is about 1 million and 5 million respectively. One can see why there is no War on Cars nor a War on Cigarettes. To conclude, rubbing out the facts prevents rational, scientific solutions to major problems, including avoidable mass mortality. My solution to the continuing global mass mortality holocaust can be summarised by the acronym CAAAA: Cessation of the violence and the lying; Acknowledgement of the human cost: Apology for First World complicity in continuing Third World mass mortality; Amends by aid, debt relief and economic decency; and Assertion that this holocaust will stop and never be repeated. Silence kills. Silence is complicity. Please inform everyone, discuss this with your associates and then act as responsible citizens. We cannot walk by on the other side.ï¿½\nItem #2 was my comment (buried among 5,505 comment thread comments but reproduced below) adding my name to an Open Letter  to pro-war, pro-Zionist, pro-US imperialism Australian Labor PM Julia Gillard in support  Australian hero and Wikileaks founder Julian Assange (see Jeff Sparrow and Elizabeth O\u0027Shea, ï¿½Open Letter: to Julia Gillard, re Julian Assangeï¿½, The Drum, 7 December 2010: http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/41914.html   ):\n ï¿½Dr Gideon Polya: 08 Dec 2010, 9:15:09 am\nA 5-decade career scientist, I fully support this letter over Julian Assange, an Australian and World hero for defending freedom of information that is vital for science-based risk management in an increasingly dangerous world.\nThe US lackey Australia Labor Government has fundamentally betrayed Australia in supporting censorship of WikiLeaks.\nActually the Wikileaks US documents re pro-war Rudd are unexceptional (we already knew that Labor is pro-war, pro-US and anti-Asian).\nThe REAL WikiLeaks scandal is that Mainstream media, academics and politicians will simply NOT report the WHO-, UN- and UNICEF-documented 2.6 million post-invasion under-5 infant deaths in US Alliance-occupied Afghanistan (90% avoidable due to Geneva Convention- and UN Genocide-violating US Alliance war crimes for which complicit Australian MPs and others should be arraigned, tried and punished).ï¿½\nThe Australian taxpayer-funded ABC is complicit in holocaust commission, genocide commission, holocaust ignoring and genocide ignoring, noting that holocaust ignoring is  far, far worse that repugnant holocaust denial because at least the latter admits the possibility of public discussion. Through its lying by omission and lying by commission the ABC has become an accessory after the fact to an Australia-complicit Iraqi Holocaust, Iraqi Genocide, Afghan Holocaust and Afghan Genocide, yet searches ï¿½of the entire ABC siteï¿½ results in ZERO (0) results. Yet a massive lie of commission ids the ABC\u0027s view of itself: ï¿½The ABC is Australia \u0027s most trusted, independent source of news. Our network of more than 500 journalists at home and abroad provide unrivalled coverage of the news events that affect Australiansï¿½ (see:   http://topsy.com/www.abc.net.au/4corners/ ).\nABC journalists around the World should be brought to account for their cowardly inhumanity and their silence in the face of the  US Alliance mass murder of Muslim children. Lord Haw Haw (William Joyce) was hanged by the British for his complicity as a journalist  in Nazi crimes but civilized people are opposed to the death penalty and indeed any constraints on freedom of speech. How then should ABC journalists be brought to book as accessories to mass murder?\nThe correct and humane direction is  provided by Dr Mahathir who as PM of Malaysia gave that country on of the lowest under-5 infant mortality rates  in the World that is currently (in terms of under-5 infant deaths per 1,000 live births) is 6 as compared to 5 (UK), 5 (Australia), 6 (Canada) and 8 (the US).  Dr Mahathir suggested a non-government non-UN war crimes tribunal of eminent World citizens (akin to the War Crimes Tribunal on Iraq that included brilliant, humanitarian Indian writer Arundhati Roy) and punishment of the perpetrators merely by the ignominy of public exposure for involvement in the mass murder of children ï¿½ they would always carry the label ï¿½War Criminal, Killer of Children, Liarï¿½.   \nAs reported by the Perdana Global Peace Organization: \"The former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad hosted the conference and won applause yesterday for calling for the leaders to be tried by an unofficial tribunal for war crimes in Iraq. He said the war had caused more terror than al-Qaeda.\"We should not hang Blair if the tribunal finds him guilty, but he should always carry the label \u0027War Criminal, Killer of Children, Liar\u0027,\" said Dr Mahathir in a speech illustrated by pictures of wounded children, deformed babies and tortured men. \"And so should Bush and the pocket Bush of the Bushland of Australia,\" he said, referring to the [Australian] Prime Minister, John Howard\" (see ï¿½Can children save the World\u0027s childrenï¿½ { through school genocide and war crimes tribunals ), Countercurrents, 10 October 2009: http://www.countercurrents.org/polya101009.htm ).\nPeace is the only way but silence kills and silence is complicity. The Occupy Movement currently exposing the violation of the 99% by the 1% in the Western Murdochracies  and Lobbyocracies must also expose the mass paedocidal crimes of the Necon American and Zionist Imperialists (NAZIs) who are still devastating much of the Muslim World (post-1990 US war-related Muslim deaths now total 12 million). All decent people must (a) inform everyone they can ï¿½ including MPs and media - about US Alliance mass murder of Muslim children and (b) take action through sanctions and boycotts against the perpetrators and their media accomplices. The World is facing a worsening climate crisis (for a collection of expert opinions see ï¿½Are we doomed?ï¿½: http://gideonclimate.blogspot.com/ ) and we can no longer tolerate mainstream media lying, whether by commission or omission (see ï¿½Mainstream media lyingï¿½: https://sites.google.com/site/mainstreammedialying/  ). The Australian ABC is not exceptional in its remorseless  lying by omission and commission  but the West\u0027s worst is the Murdoch Media Empire lead by former Australian Rupert Murdoch and accordingly we all should Boycott Murdoch Media (see: https://sites.google.com/site/boycottmurdochmedia/ ).\nDr Gideon Polya currently teaches science students at a major Australian university. He published some 130 works in a 5 decade scientific career, most recently a huge pharmacological reference text \"Biochemical Targets of Plant Bioactive Compounds\" (CRC Press/Taylor \u0026 Francis, New York \u0026 London , 2003). He has recently published ï¿½Body Count. Global avoidable mortality since 1950ï¿½ (G.M. Polya, Melbourne, 2007: http://globalbodycount.blogspot.com/ ); see also his contributions ï¿½Australian complicity in Iraq mass mortalityï¿½ in ï¿½Lies, Deep Fries \u0026 Statisticsï¿½ (edited by Robyn Williams, ABC Books, Sydney, 2007): http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ockham/stories/s1445960.htm ) and ï¿½Ongoing Palestinian Genocideï¿½ in ï¿½The Plight of the Palestinians (edited by William Cook, Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2010: http://mwcnews.net/focus/analysis/4047-the-plight-of-the-palestinians.html ). He has just published a revised and updated 2008 version of his 1998 book ï¿½Jane Austen and the Black Hole of British Historyï¿½ (see: http://janeaustenand.blogspot.com/ ) as biofuel-, globalization- and climate-driven global food price increases threaten a greater famine catastrophe than the man-made famine in British-ruled India that killed 6-7 million Indians in the ï¿½forgottenï¿½ World War 2 Bengal Famine (see recent BBC broadcast involving Dr Polya, Economics Nobel Laureate Professor Amartya Sen and others: http://www.open2.net/thingsweforgot/ bengalfamine_programme.html ).

However the first disastrous decade of the 21st century requires a modified interpretation.  Professor John Holdren of Harvard University is currently President Barack Obama’s’ chief scientific adviser.  In 2008 in an address as President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), Professor John Holdren   nominated poverty, climate and nuclear proliferation as posing major global risks.  However to these we must add lying that prevents rational responses to risk and thus the Four Horses of the Apocalypse are the Victory (of lying over reason) with consequential War (with nuclear war as the ultimate disaster), Poverty (and attendant avoidable mass mortality from deprivation and deprivation-exacerbated disease) and Death (not just of Humanity but of much of the Biosphere due to unaddressed man-made global warming).\n \nWith this in mind we can revisit the disastrous events of the first decade of the 21st century and examine how Mainstream media lying about 9-11 and other matters has enabled this worsening catastrophe.\n \n1. Experts: US did 9-11\n \nThe 9-11 atrocity involved destruction of 4 passenger planes,  3 World Trade Center buildings (the Twin Towers and the third building known as WTC7)  and part of the Pentagon. About 3,000 people, mostly Americans, perished in the attack. FBI warnings of such an attack were ignored and air defenses developed for just such an event were stood down. The Mainstream lying commenced before the atrocity had concluded. Thus the UK BBC reported the collapse of WTC7 at 4.54 pm New York time, 27 minutes before the actual collapse at 5.21pm.\n \nThe “official conspiracy theory” of the egregiously dishonest Bush Administration involved the hijacking of 4 passenger jets by 19 Muslim terrorists armed with non-lethal box-cutters with 2 planes flying into the Twin Towers, a third flying into the Pentagon and a fourth crashing in Pennsylvania after an on-board struggle. All of the alleged perpetrators were killed so that no alleged perpetrators were put on trial.  In 2011 the alleged master-mind of 9-11,  Osama bin Laden,  was supposedly murdered by US forces in Pakistan and the body dumped at sea. Most of the alleged perpetrators were Saudis and none were Afghans or Iraqis. The subsequent US investigation by the Bush Administration-appointed 9-11 Commission supported the “official story” and critically concluded that the WTC buildings had collapsed because fires had weakened the steel support columns. The US authorities quickly shipped the steel from the collapsed WTC off to Asia for destruction\n \nThe inherent implausibility of the Hollywood-style “official version” of 9-11 led to organization such as Scholars for 9/11 Truth and Justice and Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth who demanded a proper science-based inquiry. They argued that no steel-framed skyscrapers had ever collapsed due to fires and yet here were 3 collapsing in one spot on one day, noting that WTC7 had not been hit by planes and had suffered minor fires. The 9/11 Truthers advanced a hypothesis that is consistent with the available evidence and proposes that the Twin Towers were destroyed by top-to-bottom explosive demolition and WTC7 by bottom-to-top explosive demolition. \n \nScience, engineering, architecture, aviation, military and intelligence experts say that the US did 9-11, with some plausibly suggesting Israeli involvement  (see  \"Experts: US did 9-11\"). They reject the \"official conspiracy theory\" of the pathologically dishonest and violent Bush Administration that, according to the US Center for Public Integrity, told 935 lies about Iraq in the 2 years after 9-11.\n \nThus Professor Niels Harrit (Chemistry Department, 9-Nobel-Laureate University of Copenhagen) who identified unexploded nano-thermite in all World Trade Center dust samples analyzed: “We haven’t seen the evidence for this person [Osama] actually being guilty in the crime, and he is not wanted by the FBI for this attack on 9/11... There is no doubt that this building [WTC7] was taken down in a controlled demolition ... We know explosives were used... Nano-thermite shouldn’t have been there”.\nSimilarly, Major General Albert N. Stubblebine (who retired as the Commanding General of the United States Army Intelligence and Security Command, INSCOM): “You look at the buildings falling, they didn’t fall down because of an airplane hit them, they fell down because explosives went off inside. Demolition. Look at Building 7 for God sakes … I do not believe the free press is free anymore… The press is saying what they have been told to say about this. Now do I have proof about this? No. But I believe that all the stories that were told about 9/11 were false…\nWhat is it they do not want the public to know?... One of my experiences in the Army was being in charge of the Army’s Imagery Interpretation for Scientific and Technical Intelligence during the Cold War.  I measured pieces of Soviet equipment from photographs. It was my job.  I look at the hole in the Pentagon and I look at the size of an airplane that was supposed to have hit the Pentagon.  And I said, “The plane does not fit in that hole”.  So what did hit the Pentagon?  What hit it?  Where is it?  What\u0027s going on?”\nThe Mainstream media lying by omission and commission over 9-11 can be quickly established by searching using Google or the various media in-house search engines. Thus the almost certainly incorrect mantra “Al Qaeda [Muslim terrorists, Islamic extremists etc] attacked the US on 9-11” is the standard, endlessly repeated Mainstream media line despite nobody having been found guilty of the atrocity in a court of law and indeed the FBI admitting it did not have enough evidence to charge Osama bin Laden with the offence (he was on the FBI Most wanted List” for East Africa and other  bombing atrocities that killed about  30 Americans).  The ABC is Australia’s equivalent of the UK BBC but search “the entire ABC site” for “Niels Harrit” and you find only 2 results, each being comments from listeners angered over ABC censorship of  alternative hypotheses about who did 9-11.\n2. War-related dead total 9 million in post-9-11 US Alliance War on Terror \nThe first act of the Bush Administration was to declare a War on Terror that allowed for endless global war by the US against anyone it didn’t like. Since 9-11 the US has occupied Haiti, Iraq and Afghanistan, its surrogates continue  to variously occupy Haiti, Somalia, Syria, Diego Garcia and Palestine  and the US and its  allies have murderously bombed Libya, Somalia,  Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq, Afghanistan  and NW Pakistan. \nAlthough no Afghans were involved in the 9-11 atrocity, according to  the “official story”, the US promptly invaded Afghanistan post-9-11, rejecting the offer of the Taliban Afghan Government to send Osama bin Laden to a third country for investigation and trial. RAWA , Afghanistan\u0027s oldest women\u0027s political organization, is opposed to the Taliban, the US-backed war lords and the US Alliance occupiers. On the occasion of the 9th anniversary of the invasion of Afghanistan  RAWA published my documented assessment of the horrendous human cost of 3.8 million post-invasion deaths from war-imposed deprivation , 1.2 million violent deaths (from Iraq war comparisons), 2.7 million under-5 infant deaths (90% avoidable and due to US Alliance violation of the Geneva Convention)  and 3-4 million refugees. Extension of the war to NW Pakistan generated 2.5 million Pashtun refugees  (for details Google Afghan Holocaust, Afghan Genocide).\n \nAlthough no Iraqis were involved in the 9-11 atrocity according to  the “official story”, the US invaded Iraq in 2003 on the basis of a lie that Iraq possessed Weapons of Mass Destruction. The Iraq War came  at  the horrendous human cost of 1.2 million post-invasion deaths from war-imposed deprivation, 1.5 million violent deaths, 0.8 million under-5 infant deaths (90% avoidable and due to US Alliance violation of the Geneva Convention)  and 5-6 million refugees. The continuing  occupation of Iraq occurred on top of the Gulf War and Sanctions imposed on Iraq in 1990-2003 that involved 1.7 million avoidable deaths from deprivation, 0.2 million violent deaths  and 1.2 million under--5 infant deaths (see Iraqi Holocaust, Iraqi Genocide).\n \nContinuing US and US-backed violence in Somalia post-9-11 has been associated with 1.1 million violent deaths plus non-violent deaths from war-imposed deprivation. The France-UK-US (FUKUS) Coalition bombing campaign and creation of  a Libyan civil war  has so far killed 30,000 people according to the FUKUS-installed rebel government. Post-9-11war-related Muslim deaths in the US Alliance War on Terror so far total about 9 million, the breakdown being 2.7 million (Iraq), 5.0 million (Afghanistan) and 1 million (Somalia).\n \nExtraordinary Mainstream  media and politician lying have enabled this continuing  carnage. Thus if Mainstream media  report Iraqi deaths at all they quote the Iraq Body Count estimate (currently 102,000-112,000) that underestimates the 4.6 million 1990-2011 Iraq war-related deaths by a factor  of 43 an underestimates the 2.5 million 2003-2011 Iraqi war –related deaths by a factor of 23.\n \n3.  About 1 million  Americans die preventably each year linked to post-9-11, pro-war US fiscal perversion\n \nAccording to Economics Nobel Laureate Professor Joseph Stiglitz (Columbia University, New York) , the accrual cost of the Iraq War is $3.5 trillion. Dr Michael Intriligator, a senior fellow at the US Milken Institute, has suggested a long-term accrual cost of the Afghan War at $1.5 trillion to $2.0 trillion. The US is crippled by huge debt, has about 10% unemployment and is facing prolonged recession.\n \nUS war priorities have killed huge numbers of Americans at home in addition to the 4,474 killed , so far, in Iraq and the 1,760 killed , so far, in Afghanistan. Thus, for example,  the US is the richest country n the World but has an infant mortality that is similar to that of impoverished Cuba. This difference alone means that about 20,000 under-5 year old American infants die each year because of warped pro-war fiscal priorities of the US Government which is committed to spending trillions of dollars  on killing Muslims rather than to saving American lives at home. Thus, for example, there were about 31,224 firearms-related deaths in the US in 2007; about 20,000 Americans die each year due to lack of medical insurance;   over 30,000 Americans die from vehicle crashes each year; about 443,000 American deaths each year are attributable to the long-term effects of smoking (US CDC, 2010); and of 2.5 million annual deaths in the US (CDC) a substantial number are due to obesity, type 2 diabetes and other lifestyle-related problems. If we assume about 0.5 million Americans  die annually from lifestyle-related  causes  in addition  to those dying from smoking then about 1 million American die avoidably and potentially  preventably  each year.\n \nAccording to the UNODC World Drug Report (2009) “the United States saw 38,400 deaths from illicit drug use in 2006”. This corresponds to 0.6 x 0.9 x 38,400 \u003d 20,740 US opiate drug deaths yearly  linked to the US-protected Afghan opiate industry and 201,000 US opiate drug deaths  since October 2001 due to US restoration of the Taliban-destroyed Afghan opium industry. Global deaths from US Alliance restoration of the Taliban-destroyed Afghan opium industry now total about 1 million.\n \nMainstream media lying contributes to this horrendous carnage of Americans due to the pro-war fiscal perversions of the US Government.   These shocking statistics are reported by responsible bodies like the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) but not by Mainstream media which is obsessed concerned  with Zionist-promoted terror hysteria. While about 1 million Americans die preventably each year due to pro-war US fiscal perversion,  the UK News Statesman recently reported that “According to state department figures, the number of US citizens killed worldwide in 2010 \"as a result of incidents of terrorism\" was 15 (down from 25 in 2009). In the same year, 29 Americans died after being struck by lightning.\"\n \n4. 9-11 and 18 million global avoidable deaths each year from deprivation and deprivation-exacerbated disease\n \nAssuming a conservative ideal baseline of 4 deaths per 1,000 of population annually for high birth rate Developing world countries,  one can estimate from UN Population Division mortality data  that about 18 million people die avoidably each year from deprivation and deprivation-exacerbated disease in the Developing World (minus China). This is happening on Spaceship Earth with the US in charge of the flight-deck. The US has about 4.5% of the World’s population  but consumes about 25% of the World’s resources. The horrendous violence of the US throughout the world  and its massive fiscal commitment to war has caused huge devastation coupled with minimal aid. Thus about 20% of US aid goes to Apartheid Israel to support its obscene, continuing  Palestinian Genocide.\n \nIn the period 1950-2005 avoidable deaths from deprivation have totaled about 1.3 billion for the World, 1.2 billion for the Developing World and 0.6 billion for the Muslim World, these estimates being consonant with independent estimates of under-5 infant deaths in the same period totaling 0.88 billion for the World, 0.85 billion for the Developing World and 0.4 billion for the Muslim World. In the period 1950-2005, avoidable deaths from deprivation  in countries occupied in the post-war era by key players in the current US War on Terror have been 727 million (UK), 142 million (France), 82 million (the US), 72 million (Netherlands), 24 million (Apartheid Israel), and 2 million (Australia) (see “Body Count. Global avoidable mortality since 1950”) .\n \nYet Mainstream media resolutely ignore the worsening global avoidable mortality holocaust. Indeed a search of the Australian ABC for the major term “avoidable mortality” yields only 4 items, of which 2 are thanks to me.\n \nSummary\nThe three most deadly problems facing the world today are poverty, global warming and nuclear weapons proliferation. However US Alliance exploitation of the 9-11 atrocity has worsened the threat. About 3,000 people died in the  9-11 atrocity in which, according to numerous science, engineering military and intelligence experts, the US was complicit.\n \nIn the 10 years since, 9-11 war-related deaths in Iraq, Somalia and Afghanistan alone have totaled 9 million; global avoidable deaths from deprivation have totaled about 170 million; and continued global inaction on man-made climate change threatens destruction of most of humanity and the biosphere.\n \nThe US-complicit 9-11 atrocity, the subsequent US cover-up, the genocidal US War on Terror (9 million Muslims killed so far) and the US-led, Gadarene to rush fossil-fuel-based climate genocide and terracide  have all been enabled by resolute Mainstream media lying in the Western Murdochracies and Lobbyocracies.\n \nOn this 10th anniversary of 9-11 what can decent people do? Decent people must inform everyone they can about the 9 million victims of the War on Terror, as well as the initial  3,000 9-11 victims,  and the huge threat to the Planet from Mainstream media and politician lying that still enables war and suicidal fossil fuel burning.\n","source":"google_52778141428876"}

Durbin and others has been to criticize companies who havenâ€™t joined GNI rather than the organization and its current members.   Facebook and Twitter have no offices and little business in countries like China, where current GNI members are active.  (Both Facebook and Twitter are blocked or almost completely blocked in China as well as in other countries including Libya and Vietnam.)\nIn response to an earlier letter in 2009, Facebook explained it would not join GNI since, as a â€œstart-up, our resources and influence are limited.â€�  Moreover, the company reminded Durbin that it has â€œno business operations in China, or, for that matter, in most countries of the world.â€�\nBehind all of the prodding to join, of course, is the explicit threat that if GNI doesnâ€™t succeed in self-regulating the relationship between tech companies and repressive governments, Washington stands ready to regulate.  In his most recent op-ed, Durbin acknowledged that the â€œjury is still outâ€� on GNI, but wrote that if â€œU.S. companies are unwilling to take reasonable steps to protect human rights, Congress must step in.â€�\nWhat kinds of legislation does Durbin have in mind?  Perhaps restricting U.S. companies from doing business where First and Fourth Amendment values arenâ€™t supported?  Would similar restrictions be applied to foreign companies such as Baidu (a Chinese-based search engine that actively censors), which takes advantage of U.S. capital markets for funding and trading?\nIt was precisely these kinds of vague regulatory threats that motivated the original members to create GNI in the first place.  GNIâ€™s origins go back to 2006, when leading Internet companies were under considerable fire from lawmakers and human rights activists.   In particular, the companies were facing strong criticism for their willingness to comply with Chinese censorship requirements and demands to turn over identifying information about political dissidents who were using the companiesâ€™ products to advance their agendas.\nYahoo, according to The New York Times, had turned over data that led to the imprisonment of several Chinese activists, while Microsoft had â€œshut down a blog by a Chinese journalistâ€� who worked for the Times.\nGoogle, meanwhile, had infamously introduced a censored version of its search engine in 2006 to comply with government requirements.   Andrew McLaughlin, Googleâ€™s senior policy counselâ€“and later a deputy chief technology officer in the Obama White Houseâ€” explained at the time that â€œ[f]iltering our search results clearly compromises our mission. Failing to offer Google search at all to a fifth of the worldâ€™s population, however, does so far more severely.â€�\nDuring this period, I served as Associate Dean of the University of California-Berkeleyâ€™s School of Information.  (The School of Information is one of only three academic institutions listed as participants of GNI.)  In May, 2006, I was invited to a meeting convened by Orville Schell, then Dean of the UC-Berkeley School of Journalism.\nSchell has been a long-time advocate for Chinese human rights, and told the assembled group of faculty that criticism of Googleâ€™s conduct had opened a window of opportunity.  The company, he said, wanted to promote a self-regulatory body that would allow it to continue doing business in China, and had asked Schell to help develop guidelines that were heavy on disclosure and light on actual limitations.\nThat formulation sounded familiar to me.  As a management consultant in the 1980â€™s, I worked for Accenture (then Arthur Andersen) in apartheid South Africa.  At the time, companies defended their engagement with the country in part by embracing the Sullivan Principles, an acceptable code of conduct for doing business in the country developed by a Philadelphia pastor named Leon Sullivan.\nBut Sullivan ultimately regretted his principles, which he later said did not go far enough to challenge the regime and which helped, through economic engagement, to keep it legitimate.  Sullivan ultimately called on companies to pull out of South Africa altogether.\nAccording to my notes from the meeting, some attendees worried that merely disclosing the kinds of censorship that Google agreed to would not advance the human rights agenda.  â€œWhat youâ€™re describing,â€� I said, â€œsounds like the Sullivan Principles all over again.â€�\nâ€œExactly,â€� said Schell.  â€œThatâ€™s just what we want.â€�\nTwo years later, GNI was launched with Google, Yahoo and Microsoft as corporate members.  (I was not invited to any subsequent meetings.)\nA Slow Start\nSchell presumably was unaware of Sullivanâ€™s refutation of his own code, and thereâ€™s no reason to believe that GNI, as formally launched in 2008, was intended cynically as a cover for its corporate members.  The list of respected human rights organizations who have signed on as participants in GNI speaks for itself.  But GNI has always been open to the charge that it lets its members off too easily.\n(GNI Executive Director Susan Morgan acknowledges Schellâ€™s contribution to the organizationâ€™s founding, saying â€œOrville played a leadership role in one of the three independent sector-based efforts working to protect privacy and free expression online, and provided draft principles as an input into the process.  The three groups effectively integrated in late 2006 and became the basis for todayâ€™s GNI.â€�)\nThe goal of the GNI, at least, is straightforward and admirableâ€”to encourage tech companies to resist government demands to disclose private information about users, or to suppress political speech.  Participants are encouraged to challenge court orders and other legal demands in local courts, and to lobby local governments to end repressive policies and practices.\nBut between 2006 and today, GNI has little to show for its efforts.  In addition to the tortured process of developing its founding documents, the organization took considerable time to get a management team in place.  Executive director Susan Morgan was only hired in June, 2010, two years after the organization was launched.  And GNI didnâ€™t appoint its first independent chairman, former PriceWaterhouseCoopers Chairman Jermyn Brooks, until January of this year.\nWhen asked why it took so long for GNI to hire staff, Susan Morgan explains that the organizationâ€™s corporate, academic, and NGO stakeholders â€œcame to the table with very different views of what the right guidelines should be.â€�\nIndeed, according to Ebele Okobi-Harris, Yahooâ€™s Director of Business and Human Rights and a GNI Board member, GNIâ€™s slow pace is par for the course.  â€œThe NGOs,â€� Okobi-Harris said, â€œare very outspoken on some issues.â€�\nOkobi-Harris compared GNIâ€™s slow ramp-up to a similar experience with the Fair Labor Association, another multi-stakeholder coalition launched in 1996 â€œto take steps to improve working conditions around the world and to provide the public with information it could use to make informed purchasing decisions makers.â€�\nTo create FLA, apparel and footwear makers along with human rights groups spent more than two years drafting a common Code of Conduct and Principles of Monitoring.  (The group was finally incorporated three years after discussions began.)\nOnce GNI was incorporated and the Board formally established, executive director Susan Morgan says, â€œI was hired immediately and we brought on an outside Chairman about six months after Iâ€™d started, which was essential to conduct an extensive global search.â€� (No non-U.S. companies have joined GNI.)\nUnder the GNIâ€™s Principles, corporate members must establish formal procedures for dealing with key human rights issues and for responding to government requests for private information or to limit freedom of expression.   They must also submit to regular assessments of how well the company is complying with its own policies, conducted by outside assessors accredited by GNI.  (Assessments are expected to begin this year.)\nStill, not every human rights organization involved in the formation of GNI was satisfied with the results of lengthy debates.  In 2008, Amnesty International, which had been involved in early discussions, broke away from the group and has refused to join.\nAccording to a statement released by AI at the time , the final drafts of key documents â€œwere not yet strong enough to allow Amnesty International to endorse them.â€�  Amnesty cited numerous â€œweaknessesâ€� and said that â€œseveral critical issues could not be resolvedâ€� during the talks.  The World Organization for Human Rights USA also expressed disappointment that â€œthe amount of effort didnâ€™t produce something more substantial.â€�\nThe China Syndrome\nBeyond the stalled progress on substance, itâ€™s also increasingly unclear how much longer the founding members will continue to prop up the idea that GNI is working. Outside GNI, participating companies have taken very different approaches to continued relations with some governments, including China.  These unilateral actions not only question the viability of GNI, they have also created tensions among the participating companies.\nBetween 2006 and 2010, for example, Google, Yahoo and Microsoft all walked a fine line in dealing with Beijing.  Then, in January of 2010, Google dramatically revealed that unidentified operatives had hacked into the Gmail accounts of Chinese dissidents .  In response, the company radically rewrote its China policy.\nâ€œWe have decided,â€� Google announced, â€œwe are no longer willing to continue censoring our results on Google.cn, and so over the next few weeks we will be discussing with the Chinese government the basis on which we could operate an unfiltered search engine within the law, if at all.â€�\nThroughout the Chinese drama that ensued and which continues to this day, GNI â€œdidnâ€™t participate or comment.â€�  Thatâ€™s according to Cynthia Wong, Director of the Project on Global Internet Freedom at the Center for Democracy and Technology .  (CDT is a participant in GNI and largely handled the organizationâ€™s administration until it was staffed.)\n(According to Nicole Wong, Googleâ€™s Deputy General Counsel responsible for privacy, â€œThe GNI principles are broad enough to support our policies in China, both before and after we changed our approach in the country.â€�)\nThough CDTâ€™s Wong agrees that Google is doing what GNI guidelines would counsel, rumors persist that Yahoo and Microsoft were furious at Googleâ€™s unilateral actions, believing it left the two companies and their continued efforts to work with the Chinese government badly exposed and a source of embarrassment.\nCDTâ€™s Wong had no comment on whether Googleâ€™s actions generated any backlash from Yahoo or Microsoft.\nMicrosoft turned down a request to be interviewed, saying instead that they would â€œprefer to defer to GNI.â€�  The company did provide a statement, which said in part:  â€œThe GNI is an important vehicle for companies in our industry to work together with a variety of stakeholders to address important issues in other countries around the world.â€�\nThe risks of participation\nStill, several people I spoke with who are involved in GNI argue that even without strong corporate representation and the slow start to the assessment process, the organization has already delivered considerable value to its few members.\nIn particular, GNI provides corporate members a forum for discussions of best practices â€“legal and otherwiseâ€“in dealing with repressive governments.  It also provides quick and informal contacts with human rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch and the World Press Freedom Committee, who can help verify the identity of possible government targets.\nBut why have no other companies joined GNI since its launch?  According to CDTâ€™s Cynthia Wong, â€œCompanies arenâ€™t joining because they donâ€™t know what kind of value goes on in the internal discussionsâ€¦but theyâ€™re in denial about the reputational risk they face.â€�\nThe difficulty companies have calculating the danger of cooperating with repressive governments could certainly be part of GNIâ€™s problem.  But social media companies including Facebook and Twitter are well aware of the â€œreputationalâ€� risk they face even when dealing with privacy and free speech issues in the U.S.  In January, for example, Twitter fought court orders demanding the company turn over information it had on Twitter users associated with Wikileaks, and challenged a gag order on revealing the request.  And Facebook is all too aware of the role its product has played in uprisings throughout the Middle East in the last few months.\nSo if denial about the reputational risk of not participating in GNI doesnâ€™t explain the failure of companies such as Facebook and Twitter to join, what does?\nPart of the problem is surely the risks of working with human rights groups that simply donâ€™t understand how technology works.  While Yahooâ€™s Okobi-Harris is confident the companyâ€™s interactions through with GNI have been â€œindispensable,â€� she acknowledged that working with so many different advocacy groups makes decision-making difficult.\nAnd the NGOs arenâ€™t just there to give advice.   The â€œmulti-stakeholderâ€� structure of the founding group has been replicated in GNIâ€™s permanent organization.  Governance of GNI is based on a board of directors made up of equal numbers of company representatives and representatives of NGOs, academics and investors, plus a voting outside Chairman.  (The non-corporate participants can join GNI â€œfor a nominal fee,â€� according to executive director Susan Morgan.)\nThe current principles were adopted prior to the formal creation of its board of directors.  But the board now has considerable power.  It can amend the core documents, determine compliance of a participating company, change funding commitments or place a company on â€œspecial review.â€�\nThese actions, itâ€™s true, require a super-majority of the board.  But a simple majority can decide on accreditation of outside assessors, extend the term of existing board members, admit new members and adopt recommendations related to reporting and participation requirements for company members. â€œAll members have the opportunity to participate in the policy, learning and outreach and communications work of GNI,â€� according to Morgan.\nTime and Effort, and Money\nIf GNI were simply a forum for bringing corporate executives and human rights groups together, itâ€™s possible more companies would join.  But thereâ€™s much more to GNI.  Its core documents run to over thirty pages and more than 13,000 words.  The texts read much like those of some of the most notoriously obtuse E.U. and U.N. organizations, from which many of the key terms and definitions are drawn.\nThere are also significant costs to participating in GNI, not the least of which are requirements that demand significant time and human resources, especially for smaller companies and start-ups.  Beyond the commitment to pursue GNIâ€™s core human rights agenda, the organizing documents lay out a number of administrative obligations for participating companies.  These include:\nCreation within each participating company of a â€œsenior-directed human rights team.â€�\nEstablishing â€œwritten procedures that ensure consistent implementation of policies that protect freedom of expression and privacy and documenting compliance with these policies.â€�\nDisclosure requirements to users of what â€œgenerally applicable government laws and policies require the participating company to provide personal information to government authorities, unless such disclosure is unlawful.â€�\nDisclosure of â€œwhat personal information the participating company collects, and the participating companyâ€™s policies and procedures for responding to government demands for personal information.â€�\nSubmission of an annual report to GNI â€œdetailing its experiences in making the Principles operational, including challenges the participating company has faced and the nature of the reactions of governments.â€�\nParticipating in a bi-annual â€œassessmentâ€� of the companyâ€™s compliance with the Principles by a pool of â€œindependent assessorsâ€� accredited by GNIâ€™s board.\nâ€œActively participateâ€� in GNI meetings and/or other activities, or face termination by the board.\nThere is also the financial commitment.  Though GNI would not disclose its cost structure, Morgan says that the membership fee for companies joining GNI â€œis a sliding scale based on revenue.â€�  (Tech startups may have revenue, but profits and cash flow are different matters.)\nEven more than money is the time commitment of already over-stretched employees, especially senior executives.  Facebook and Twitter have only a fraction of the employees of Google, Microsoft and Yahoo.  Even today, Twitter has only about 300 employees.  Their legal and policy group is only a handful of lawyers.  How big of a â€œsenior-directed human rights teamâ€� would the company be expected to staff?\nWhose job is this, anyway?\nParticipating companies could always quit the organization if these requirements become onerous or otherwise interfered with their ability to do business.  But what is the â€œreputational riskâ€� of turning your back on GNI and the powerful human rights organizations who are members?\nWhich suggests an even deeper problem with GNI.  Why do the human rights groups who participate in GNI believe tech companies are responsible for foreign policy?  GNI doesnâ€™t just require its members to stretch the limits of local laws to protect human rights.  It also expects companies to become political operatives on GNIâ€™s behalf.  According to the organizationâ€™s Implementation Guidelines, GNI participants are required to â€œengage government officials to promote the rule of law and the reform of laws, policies and practices that infringe on freedom of expression and privacy.â€�\nBut why does GNI believe it is the duty of companies to pressure foreign governments to improve their human rights laws and practices?   Isnâ€™t that the job of a countryâ€™s own citizens, or other governments as part of deliberated foreign policy?  Why, in effect, is the U.S. government given a free pass on doing what might normally be understood as its duty to â€œengage public policyâ€�?  (Governments are not members of GNI.)\nItâ€™s true that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has recently called for global debate on the Internetâ€™s use as a tool for both freedom and repression .  But rather than threaten U.S. companies who donâ€™t join GNI, as Sen. Durbin has done repeatedly, why doesnâ€™t Congress put pressure on the governments who ask for the kinds of cooperation that most disturbs the human rights community?\nOne form of leverage governments have here is in trade negotiations, as Google in particular has pointed out.  In November of last year, the company issued a white paper calling on U.S. and European governments to treat â€œlimits on the free flow of informationâ€� as what they really areâ€“a kind of unfair trade barrier.\nWhen local governments restrict the kinds of information U.S. companies can deliver to their citizens, Google argues, they should be sanctioned just as if they blockaded physical goods to protect local suppliers.\nThe Power of Mooreâ€™s Law\nIn any event, companies who are not participants in GNI already lobby on behalf of human rights.  Facebook provided a statement, which said in part,\nWe are in regular contact with governments and non-governmental organizations which have an interest in this issue in the U.S. and around the world, such as GNI.  As Facebook grows, weâ€™ll continue to expand our outreach and participation, but itâ€™s important to remember that our global operations are still small, with offices in only a handful of countries.â€�\nBut Harvard Law Schoolâ€™s John Palfrey is among the members of GNI who arenâ€™t impressed by such displays of substance over form.  As he put it in a recent op-ed for The New York Daily News ,\nThe Global Network Initiative is, at least so far, a relatively docile nonprofit organization; it is not yet feared by regimes like Egyptâ€™s, and it may never be. But thereâ€™s a way to give it more teeth: Twitter and Facebook should immediately join in the effort, as should Cisco and other companies that are playing big roles in the ways that activism and governance are taking place in cyberspace. More powerful players will make it more robust â€“ and its principles more enforceable.â€�\nPalfrey goes on to say, â€œIf the market does not work and companies do not come together voluntarily, we will need other mechanisms to ensure that platforms like Twitter and Facebook and many mobile digital tools â€“ and those that will inevitably come after them â€“ will stay live in times of crisis.â€�\nMaybe not.  Despite GNIâ€™s failure, the market is doing just fineâ€”or rather, the technology is.  Though repressive regimes continue to view information technology as a threat to their control over citizens, itâ€™s abundantly clear that the services offered by Internet companies have helped the causes of freedom and democracy tremendously.  Indeed, technology has done more to advance human rights in the last ten years than all the multi-stakeholder coalitions put together.\nChina and other repressive regimes, of course, continue to keep information flows to a minimum, but the pressure of faster, cheaper, and smaller computers is unrelenting.  Egypt shut down the Internet (an option that some U.S. lawmakers would like to give the President of this country as well.)  But how long was Egyptâ€™s government able to keep the Internet closed?\nFacebook and Twitter were barely in existence in 2006 when discussions about GNI first began.  But even today neither company can be blamed for steering clear of a groupâ€“however noble its principlesâ€“whose internal politics are unduly complex and whose progress has been so plodding and unremarkable.\nTheir employees are focused on making better products and services and serving more and more of the worldâ€™s population.  Whether by design or happy accident, that turns out to be the best way to serve the cause of human rights.\nAnd the most efficient, too.\n","source":"google_52778141428876"}

(Stan Honda/AFP/Getty Images)\nWhat do you think?\nBANGKOK, Thailand — After Cyclone Nargis left a trail of corpses along Burma’s coast in May 2008, foreign aid workers clamored to enter the military-controlled backwater.\nDespite the world’s pleading, Burma’s paranoid generals forbade most foreign relief workers from entering the disaster zone. A frustrated U.K. threatened unauthorized air drops. The U.S. Navy was forced to float vessels loaded with life-saving supplies offshore.\nBut among the few who managed to access Burma’s worst-hit areas included adherents of the California-based Church of Scientology.\nAccording to the church, miracles ensued after Scientologists touched down. Their team sought out traumatized Burmese for Scientology’s touch-healing techniques, professed to revive the spirit.\nThe infirm recouped strength, they said, and Burmese kids who’d lost their families regained their smiles. As the church tells it, even the surgeon of Aung San Suu Kyi, the country’s revered pro-democracy icon, wanted his personal relief troupe to adopt Scientology techniques.\n“He goes, ‘This is amazing! I’m a doctor and I can’t even do this!’” said Andy Ponnaz, 57, a Bangkok-born Scientologist of mixed Thai-Swiss blood.\n“I said, ‘Sir, I can teach all of your crew tomorrow. How many? 40? OK!’”\nThe far reach of Scientology\nThose who know of Scientology through media exposes, or South Park’s stinging cartoon parody, may wonder what interests Scientology could possibly have in one of Asia’s most remote jungles.\nThe Western media has largely focused on Scientology’s celebrity followers, its secret scriptures and its costly hierarchy of enlightenment. Defectors’ tell-alls have shaken the religion’s public image. An internet campaign known as “Anonymous” vows to do much worse: destroy the church entirely.\nBut while Scientology endures scrutiny in America, the faith’s influence is quietly expanding in countries that lie beyond the Western media’s glare. In Burma, there is no South Park. Nor does the din of criticism reach non-English speakers in Indonesian cities ruined by earthquakes. Or poor hamlets in Ghana. Or crumbling city blocks in Chile.\nScientologists reach all these places and more. The faith has dispatched its yellow-clad “Volunteer Ministers” to almost every major global disaster in the last decade: from the 2001 World Trade Center attacks to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami to Japan’s earthquake-ravaged coast.\nTen years ago, this relief brigade was estimated at 6,000 people. Now, according to church stats, it’s up to 350,000 and growing. Within the past 12 months, the church’s volunteer ministers claim to have treated 3.1 million people in 185 nations and territories.\nScientologists call their volunteer ministers “the largest independent relief force on earth,” an assertion that rivals the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies claim of 97 million volunteers. But this is hardly the two groups’ only point of distinction.\nWhat is an \"assist\"?\nScientology relief work is largely focused on delivering “assists,” a menu of touch-healing techniques said to reconnect ailing bodies with immortal spirits.\nThe healing promised by assists is radical: limbs purged of aches in minutes and minds freed from trauma on the spot. Using only their hands, and instructions from the Scientology Handbook, ministers swear they can even render a drunk man sober in minutes .\n  \nIs this tent revival-style faith healing? According to Scientologists, no. It’s described as a spiritual science, developed by their founder, the sci-fi novelist-turned-religious leader L. Ron Hubbard.\nMainstream psychiatry is uneasy with Scientologists’ forays into trauma relief. But in the church’s eyes, they are often the only force with the spiritual expertise disaster relief requires.\n“When people are walking around like zombies, we can cut through that and say, \u0027You, come here. Just lie down,\u0027” said Ponnaz, the organization executive secretary of the church’s Bangkok foundation.\n“They get results. Then the tables turn and they go, ‘Give me more!’”\nEveryday believers\nTo an Asian villager in a disaster zone, a Scientologist is not Tom Cruise or John Travolta, the faith’s best-known believers. It’s a guy like Gary Bromwell, a tanned and silver-haired Australian from Perth.\nBromwell, one of the church’s most-traveled volunteer ministers, has missed few of Asia’s recent calamities. He recalls Indonesian troops weeping when afternoon rains stirred tsunami flashbacks. He’s encountered a boy whose face was dragged against the ground by waves until teeth showed through his cheek.\n“Have you ever seen someone in shock? Their eyes are sort of vacant like no one’s home,” said Bromwell via phone from New Zealand, where he led a Scientology team in Christchurch. The city was rocked by a 6.3-magnitude quake in February.\n“Their lights are out,” he said. “That’s because the majority of their attention is stuck back in time, on wax, at the point of trauma.”\nBromwell’s objective is to bring survivors back to “present time,” he explained. In Scientology lingo, the person’s “thetan,” or immortal spirit, is hung up on the traumatic event, leaving the body unable to properly heal.\nIf spotted by a Scientologist, a dazed disaster survivor is asked to lie down on a padded folding table beneath a tent. The person’s trauma-stricken spirit is then reconnected to the body, so say the Scientologists, with a combination of verbal instructions and touch techniques.\nPhysical injury is often handled with a “nerve assist.” The injured person lies belly-down, then supine, while a Scientologist traces fingers along their spine and strokes their limbs. The motion, according to the Scientology Handbook, unclogs blocked energy “improving communication with the body and bringing the being relief.”\nMentally trauma is treated with a “contact assist,” in which a survivor is asked to re-enact a troubling event at the location where it occurred.\nA tsunami survivor, for example, may be asked to revisit the sea, coming closer and closer to the water until they can bear to dip their toes in the surf. (But Scientologists must “never forcibly drag the person up to the spot with the injury or accident occurred,” according to the handbook.)\nTestimonials of touch healing\n“These people have seen some nasty things and often that stays in their mind,” Bromwell said. “We do assists to relieve that. Then they can go home, sleep, and they don’t have those pictures stuck in their minds.”\nIn New Zealand, Bromwell found a boy who obsessed over the quake and suffered constipation for seven days. After applying Scientology’s healing powers, Bromwell said, the boy was suddenly able to relieve himself and play outside without fear.\nKatrina Gregory, another Australian Scientologist, recounted her own miracles from rubble-strewn Christchurch. One man’s ankle was struck by a falling cable. Gregory, who is 33 and works as a personal assistant in Tasmania, restored the man’s ability to walk, she said.\n“They’re pretty much jumping on the table because they’re hurting and sore and just want to feel better,” Gregory said. “I’ve done a thousand of these things and it amazes me how it always works.”\nOther accounts are even more spectacular. In the book “After the Tsunami,” written by a Danish Scientologist, British actor and Scientologist Robbie Scandrett recalled treating an 11-year-old Indian girl who “had not slept since the tsunami and kept hearing the waves, creating a deep fear of the sea.”\nScandrett offered a “touch assist,” which requires touching parts of the girl’s body while saying “feel my finger.” Five minutes into the session, the girl “lost consciousness and slumped into her chair,” according to the account.\nAnother 45 minutes passed before “her eyes opened very slightly and tears streamed down her cheeks ... her response was that she no longer felt any fear of the sea.”\nBut several people who have received assists, when contacted by Global Post, likened the nerve assist to a massage: pleasant, but not life altering.\n“It was quite formal. They didn’t say much, only ‘I’m going to do a nerve assist on you,’” said Lalan Susanti, an Indonesian translator who worked in Aceh after the 2004 tsunami. “I laid down and they just used their fingers, going up and down the spine, then back up again.”\n“After a few days, looking at all the debris and dead bodies, you feel tired inside and out. It was relieving,” said Susanti. “They were doing it to all the locals and they never said a word about religion.”\nBack to the beginning with L. Ron Hubbard\n“When I was a very young man, I spent most of my teens in Asia,” said Hubbard, Scientology’s founder, in an interview released by the church before his 1986 death.\nHubbard claimed in the interview to have “slept with bandits in Mongolia” and “hunted with pygmies in the Philippines.” His experiences led him to know Asia as “an area of the world where human misery and want are very visible, where man has reached perhaps the lowest states of degradation.”\nHis solution to this pervasive misery? A sweeping re-think of the mankind’s mind and soul called “Dianetics,” published in 1950. It was his first major genre departure from science fiction and is now revered by the church as a founding text.\nIn \"Dianetics,\" Hubbard asserts that most physical and mental ills are “psychosomatic” or induced by the mind. Negative experiences, he said, create mental images that get stuck in an unconscious vault of pain: the “reactive mind.”\nIf the images aren’t confronted and purged, Hubbard wrote, they lie in wait to trigger self-destructive behavior or even physical illness.\n“Discharge the contents of this mind’s bank,” Hubbard wrote in Dianetics, “and the arthritis vanishes, myopia gets better, heart illness decreases, asthma disappears, stomachs function properly and the whole catalog of ills goes away and stays away.”\nAn electronic trauma detector?\nOut in the field, volunteer ministers try to clear out this mental muck with assists. But their preferred method uses an electronic device to detect bad experiences, some of which they believe took place in previous lives.\nThe device is called an “e-meter.” The breadbox-sized unit, studded with dials and knobs, sends five electric volts into the body through two metal handles gripped by the person being “audited.” A trained “auditor” asks the person to recount painful memories over and over in vivid detail.\nThose memories — believed by Scientologists to have actual energy and mass — can be detected on the e-meter’s dials, according to Hubbard. As the person confronts their pain, the bad experience will lose its sway over the mind.\n“It’s a very precise machine,” said Ponnaz, popping open his e-meter’s heavily reinforced black travel case. “Any bit of pain or trauma is like a mass in your mind. And it registers.”\nScience community speaks out\nPsychiatrists, however, have largely dismissed all this as pseudo-science. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ruled the e-meter is “not medically or scientifically capable of improving the health or bodily functions.” And many psychiatrists have a dim view of Scientologists using these techniques on traumatized villagers.\n“The Red Cross requires psychiatrists to take considerable training before they’ll allow them to go into a disaster site,” said Nada Stotland, a Chicago-based psychiatrist with Mental Health America, a non-profit advocacy group based in northern Virginia.\n“They’re untrained,” said Stotland, who is also a former president of the American Psychiatric Association. “They have completely untested methods of dealing with people’s problems. These techniques have never shown results in scientific tests of any kind.”\nMental Health America even warned Scientologists to “stay out of mental health” after volunteer ministers rushed to New York City after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.\nThe church’s view of psychiatry, however, is equally harsh.\nWell-funded Scientology campaigns denounce psychiatry as an “industry of death” that peddles worthless therapy and spirit-clouding pills. Scientologists warn that “psychiatry kills” — they are particularly disdainful of shock therapy — and forbid one another from taking psychoactive pills.\n“Has anyone been to a psychiatrist and actually gotten better?” Ponnaz said. “Our technology is available, written in normal terms, not high language. A guy on the street can read and understand it.”\nScientology takes hold in Asia\nIn a church promotional video, Phra Dang, an orange-robed buddhist monk, steps along a forested path. In single file, his faithful follow him into a temple classroom. Inside, he clutches “Dianetics” and his followers read a Thai-language copy of “The Way to Happiness,” an entry-level Hubbard text.\n“I am Phra Dang,” says the monk, flanked by a large golden Buddha. “And I use Scientology in Thailand.”\nJust as Scientology caters to celebrity “opinion leaders” — figures able to sway public sentiment — its volunteer ministers concentrate on winning over local religious leaders, police chiefs, doctors and varied authority figures.\nOutside the Western world, some of these earliest successes are taking root in Thailand, Southeast Asia’s medical hub. At one of Bangkok’s most prestigious public hospitals, Siriraj, a Thai research nurse has proclaimed Scientology’s merit for several years.\n“I have seen the effectiveness of these methods,” said Chanakan Boonnuch, speaking to Scientology’s New York branch in 2009, according to a church release. “Now I intend to speak about them in international journals and conferences.”\nExperiences in Burma led another Thai doctor, 40-year-old physical rehabilitation specialist Ong-ard Sirikulphisut, to evaluate Scientology techniques scientifically.\nOn a laptop in Scientology’s Bangkok office, Ong-ard pulled up a photo of a Burmese woman. Her eyes appeared dead. She stared down at the dirt. Only her husband and 6-month-old infant survived the cyclone, he said. The rest of her family was killed.\n“She swallowed a lot of sea water,” Ong-ard said, “She was severely stressed to the point of banging her head into the wall. So we gave her a nerve assist.”\nIn subsequent photos, the woman manages a slight smile that dimples her cheeks. Ong-ard later examined her case and 55 others, publishing the results in a Thai medical journal. His findings: “for the survivors, nerve assist procedure had 73.53 percent effectiveness in physical and mental stress relief in the first session.”\nOng-ard has worked for years at a pubic hospital in Chachoengsao, a province east of Bangkok. He first learned of Scientology eight years ago through a display on one of Bangkok’s busiest avenues. “There was this photo of L. Ron Hubbard auditing a woman,” he recalls. “I later came in for a seminar.”\nHe has since taught hundreds of his patients’ relatives to rely on Scientology assists to heal their loved ones. “They ask me, ‘Do you have magic in your finger?’” Ong-ard said. “Now that I’ve taught them, they go out to apply it on other sick people.”\nThis doctor, a graduate of one of Thailand’s most highly regarded colleges, is just one of thousands disseminating Scientology techniques in the developing world.\nThe church’s press releases boast of bigger and more remote training sessions each month: 40 nurses in Kolkata, 300 villagers in Papua New Guinea, 500 teachers in Ghana, 1,200 “fathers, mothers, nurses and even children” in Pakistan. In India, Scientology is known more as a self-help technique than a religion, but it has attracted thousands of followers nonetheless.\nThe church even dispatched ministers to wade into Bangkok’s recent color-coded street protests to pass out Scientology texts. “We’ve handed out this book [The Way to Happiness] to the Red Shirts, the Yellow Shirts, when they’re all kicking and shooting at each other,” Ponnaz said.\nScientologists insist their techniques are increasingly favored by public officials. Indonesia’s education department asked Bromwell to teach techniques to students at a primary school filled with traumatized kids after severe quakes, he said.\nDuring Australia’s recent brush fires, Gregory said she was “getting people from the Red Cross, from the Salvation Army asking me what I could do for them.” And in post-tsunami Thailand, Ponnaz said, officials relied on Scientologists to restore order to a panicked public.\n“The prime thing is order,” he said. “The pubic wanted to find out if their loved ones were in the morgue. Half were losing it, so they go into assists. They wake up and say, good, I got it. What am I here for? My brother’s body. Instead of flipping out, they’ve calmed down.”\nThe secret scriptures\nA complex chart titled the “Bridge to Total Freedom” details the hierarchy Scientologists must climb to unravel life’s true meaning. “Factually,” it reads, “you’ve been traveling this universe a long time without a map. Now you’ve got one.”\nThe chart itself is no secret. In Bangkok’s Scientology center, as in many Scientology offices, it’s tacked to the wall for all to see.\nBut secret scriptures become available to those who reach senior levels, particularly Operating Thetan III, a rank achieved only after passing through what the chart describes as a “wall of fire.”\nPonnaz is an Operating Thetan VII, the penultimate rank. (The final available level, Operating Thetan VIII, is achieved at sea aboard a Scientology vessel.)\n“I’m not going to talk to you about anything up there,” said Ponnaz of the bridge’s highest levels. “You’re here,” he said, pointing to the stage of the uninitiated: pre-clear.\n“That’s not invalidating you,” he said. “It’s just saying, well, I know some stuff up here that if I just went ‘blah’ to you, it would throw you into a spin.”\nThe church’s public material tells of an ancient, non-fiction account — the “Space Opera” — that includes “space travel, spaceships, spacemen, intergalactic travel, wars, conflicts, other beings’ civilizations and societies, and other planets and galaxies.”\nWhether the space opera is core to Scientology’s advanced scripture, as church defectors allege, is not publicly addressed by the church.\n“I am not going to discuss the disgusting perversions of Scientology beliefs that can now be found commonly on the internet,” said Tommy Davis, the church’s chief spokesman, in an interview last year with ABC’s Nightline. Pressed further, he yanked out his lapel mic and walked off set.\nScientology detractors point out that accessing the loftiest scriptures requires coursework that can cost tens of thousands of dollars.\nVia the internet, a number of vocal church defectors have made a game of releasing as many secret documents as they can.\nAnyone who punches “scientology” into Google’s search engine will see an equal number of official church sites and critical sites openly detailing the alleged secret scriptures. The church has returned fire in court, where lawyers have argued these texts are protected trade secrets.\nPonnaz, a Bangkok hotelier and aviator, has zero regrets about his investment. Those with less cash to spare, he said, can always earn free or reduced price courses by volunteering to audit fellow Scientologists with the e-meter.\n“It’s like saying ‘I want a Porsche, but it’s too expensive.’” he said. “That doesn’t fly.”\nScientology\u0027s mixed reviews\nPsychiatrists dismiss Scientology’s relief brigade as simply ineffectual. Others allege much worse.\nScientology’s most aggressive enemy is a faceless online movement called “Anonymous,” which first announced its intentions to tear down Scientology in a 2008 YouTube video.\n“The extent of your malign influence over those who have come to trust you as leaders has been made clear to us,” said a robotic voice droning over over scenes of swirling skies. “Anonymous has therefore decided that your organization should be destroyed.”\nAnonymous — a “hate group,” according to the church — sees sinister intent behind almost every move the church makes. The volunteer ministers are not spared: they’re depicted as “vulture ministers” out to prey on and convert vulnerable survivors.\nBut recruitment in disaster zones, Bromwell said, is prohibited by the church. “In fact, if anyone is not following the program ... and trying to get people to become Scientologists, they’re instantly shipped out,” he said. “I’ve only had to do that once.”\nA former aid worker with the non-profit group Peace Brigades, Paul Zeccola, remembers that Scientologists “stood out as part of the circus that came in to Aceh” after Indonesia’s tsunami. At first, he and his colleagues were highly skeptical of the ministers in yellow.\n“But I didn\u0027t hear about anything dodgy from anyone,” said Zeccola, now pursuing a political studies doctorate at Australian National University.\n“I saw them getting their hands dirty in terms of cleaning up the mess that the tsunami caused,” he said, “unlike a lot of other expats up there who stayed in the comfortable offices writing reports and going across to Sabang for diving and partying.”\nTo Evi Narti Zain, an female aid worker from Aceh, the Scientologists she met after the tsunami were neither vultures nor miracle workers.\nZain recalls passing by a crew of Scientologists soon after the waves scattered 150,000 water-logged bodies across Aceh and Sumatra provinces. The volunteer ministers had set up camp by the local municipal headquarters and invited Zain into their tent for a nerve assist.\nShe climbed onto a folding table and lied down. A Scientologist touched her “very gently,” she recalled. It was over within minutes.\n“I didn’t feel anything. Even relief,” Zain said. “But I do appreciate their effort. Specifically those who helped pick up the dead bodies.”\nhttp://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/culture-lifestyle/world-religion/110329/scientology-disaster-zone-tsunami-asia\n","source":"google_52778141428876"}

How Google became a “neutrality” target\nWhy draw the line at ISPs? If the FCC passes \"neutrality\" rules, ISPs and …\nby Nate Anderson - Apr 30, 2010 2:32 am UTC\n65\nIf ISPs should be subject to \"net neutrality,\" should companies like Google be subject to \"search neutrality\"?\nWhen we wrote recently about the idea of \"search neutrality,\" some readers seemed to believe that we had coined the term, but nothing could be further from the truth. \"Search neutrality\" now fills the FCC filings of companies like Comcast, Time Warner Cable, and AT\u0026T, all of whom see no reason why their businesses should be picked out for regulatory scrutiny while Google goes about its business unmolested.\nSo where did the idea of search neutrality come from, and what does it mean?\n\"Get ready to regulate Google\"\nNet neutrality wasn\u0027t dreamed up by consumer interest groups, springing fully formed from the head of Gigi Sohn (Public Knowledge) or Ben Scott (Free Press). Nor did it start as a secret Google plot to clobber the ISPs.\nNo, net neutrality is just the latest attempt to answer some ancient questions concerning fairness, monopolies, and infrastructure. In 2008, University of Colorado law prof Phil Weiser (now in the Obama Department of Justice) wrote a paper of his own that offered this pithy summary of the basic issue .\nIn an important sense, the network neutrality debate merely replicates a debate now over one hundred years old in the telecommunications industry and public utility regulation more generally. In particular, a provider of basic infrastructure—a railroad or a telecommunications network—will often seek some share of the available rents from the goods or services carried on their platform. Without regulatory oversight, or countervailing monopoly power on the part of the goods manufacturer (as Standard Oil enjoyed as to oil), the railroad companies were renowned (and detested) for charging supra-competitive prices that limited the potential profits available to the farmers whose goods were shipped via their platform.\nSimilarly, AT\u0026T sought to entirely monopolize the provision of goods that worked in conjunction with its network, famously opposing \u0027foreign attachments\u0027 and claiming for itself the sole right to charge (supra-competitive rents) for applications like telephones that connected to the network. In response to both the abuses of monopoly power by the railroads and the Bell System, calls for transparency and competition policy oversight prevailed on the ground that society could not tolerate a state of affairs where \u0027a monopoly infrastructure business, in pursuit of its own ends, could take steps that would ruin one business and make another succeed.\u0027\nBut even when you accept this idea, there are further questions to be answered about where remedies might be applied. ISPs are an obvious chokepoint, but there may be others. (The difficulty of drawing preemptive lines led Weiser to support an antitrust model, where regulators intervene after problems arise.)\nBack in 2008, the University of Minnesota\u0027s Andrew Odlyzko wrote an important piece called \"Network neutrality, search neutrality, and the never-ending conflict between efficiency and fairness in markets\" (PDF), which he later updated in 2009.\nThe piece took a big picture look at the debate over net neutrality, arguing that the ideas behind it were really part of a policy debate \"going back for centuries.\" He and Weiser agreed: the debate reflected a fundamental tension between \"efficiency and fairness in markets, a tension that has never been completely resolved.\"\nOdlyzko is a hugely respected voice on the economics of networks and on the growth of Internet traffic, so his words carried particular weight: \"Should net neutrality or some similar set of rules come to dominate (either because of market forces, or through regulation), attention would likely turn to other parts of the economy that might be perceived as choke points for social, economic, and political activities.\n\"If Net search becomes as important as the Google stock price seems to imply, for example, it might be the focal point for such concerns... It is possible to argue that the best outcome might be to have Google defeat AT\u0026T in the battle over net neutrality, but then (and likely in any case) society might have to get ready to regulate Google!\"\nFrom the ivory tower to the Grey Lady\nAs the Genachowski-led FCC started the first official rulemaking on net neutrality in 2009, opponents of the idea followed up on the puckish suggestions of Odlyzko and others. By late 2009, the idea of extending \"neutrality\" to search was picking up steam in the think tank world.\nIn October 2009, the libertarian-leaning Progress \u0026 Freedom Foundation made the case that \"search neutrality\" (the term was new enough it still required quote marks) was logically as important as \"network neutrality\" and that it was not just a \"sour grapes\" proposal from ISPs. The idea was to show just how far the government would inevitably go if net neutrality became an official rule.\n\"The basic premise of neutrality regulation is already being proposed for other layers of the Internet—and not just by AT\u0026T in retaliation. One need not agree with all of AT\u0026T’s accusations to recognize that, whatever the FCC might say today, any large online intermediary with a popular platform potentially faces the threat of \u0027network neutrality\u0027 mandates—because every platform is essentially a \u0027network,\u0027 too. We’re not just talking about \u0027search neutrality\u0027 (Google as well as Microsoft) but also about \u0027device neutrality\u0027 (mobile handsets), \u0027app neutrality\u0027 (Apple’s iTunes store, Facebook’s developers and Google’s Android mobile OS) and so on for social networking, email, instant messaging, online advertising, etc.\"\nWhile PFF is funded mainly by ISPs (AT\u0026T, Comcast, Cox, Verizon, etc.) and big rightsholders (NBC, EMI, CBS, etc.), it also gets money from Google and Microsoft—which don\u0027t like this way of thinking at all.\nBut it soon showed up in the Wall Street Journal, too. That same month, Bret \" Exaflood/Exacloud \" Swanson, who had formerly worked at PFF, was given the op-ed page to spread some doubt about net neutrality\u0027s limits.\n\"If net neutrality applies neutrally to all players in the Web ecosystem, then it would regulate every component and entrepreneur in a vast and unknowable future,\" he wrote. \"If neutrality applies selectively (oxymoron alert) to only one sliver of the network, then it is merely a political tool of one set of companies to cripple its competitors.\"\nThen came the horror stories. In the late summer and autumn of 2009, UK entrepreneur Adam Raff launched the site searchneutrality.org to describe his own shabby treatment at the hands of Google. Raff\u0027s vertical search engine, Foundem, had been \"penalized\" by Google\u0027s search engine. From 2006 through most of 2009, his site was \"effectively disappeared from the Internet,\" and Google soon put him in an AdWords penalty box, too. Yahoo and Bing applied no such penalties. Raff argued that Google was targeting him as a competitor.\nAfter years of appeals, Google finally agreed to manually whitelist Foundem. Two days after Christmas,  Raff took the pages of The New York Times to describe his situation but mostly to call for expanded net neutrality rules. If the proposed new principles of \"nondiscrimination\" and \"transparency\" were good enough for ISPs, they\u0027d better apply to dominant Internet companies like Google, too.\n\"Without search neutrality rules to constrain Google’s competitive advantage, we may be heading toward a bleakly uniform world of Google Everything — Google Travel, Google Finance, Google Insurance, Google Real Estate, Google Telecoms and, of course, Google Books,\" wrote Raff.\nSuch sites are incorporated into Google\u0027s search results; type in part of an address and a Google Maps box appears above all search results. Similar things happen with other services; type in a song title, and Google\u0027s special music box appears at the top of the results, allowing users to listen on Lala, iLike, or Pandora. Raff believes this gives Google an unfair advantage; it can enter any market and instantly see massive traffic if it wants to do so, simply by integrating its other products with search.\n\"Google was quick to recognize the threat to openness and innovation posed by the market power of Internet service providers, and has long been a leading proponent of net neutrality. But it now faces a difficult choice. Will it embrace search neutrality as the logical extension to net neutrality that truly protects equal access to the Internet? Or will it try to argue that discriminatory market power is somehow dangerous in the hands of a cable or telecommunications company but harmless in the hands of an overwhelmingly dominant search engine?\"\nOn to the FCC!\nAt the FCC, ISPs and other opponents of net neutrality stepped up their discussion of \"search neutrality.\" Google was perceived as the biggest corporate backer of the neutrality idea, and the ISPs wanted to make sure that Google felt a little pain if the FCC went ahead with the rules. Perhaps such a move would convince Google to moderate its stance.\nSo, in early 2010, we saw comments like this one from Time Warner Cable . \"Several application behemoths are among the staunchest supporters of net neutrality regulation, but ironically, much of their conduct appears inconsistent with the principles of openness that they espouse. Most notably, Google has led the charge to adopt regulation to ensure Internet openness, yet it has the ability and incentive to engage in a range of decidedly non-neutral conduct due to its control over so many aspects of the Internet experience.  Google’s core search application relies on a pay-for-priority scheme that is squarely at odds with its proposed neutrality requirements for broadband Internet access service providers.\"\nComcast got in on the fun , too, telling the FCC, \"If the Commission were to conclude that an interventionist regulatory regime is needed to preserve the ‘neutrality’ of the Internet, it could not defensibly apply that regime to broadband providers but not to Google (or any other provider of Internet-based services).\"\nAT\u0026T went so far as to tell the FCC that nothing it could possible do would be as worrisome as what Google was up to. \"And more than any physical network provider, search engines pose concerns that the [rulemaking] identifies as a potential basis for government intervention: They \u0027determine the information . . . that customers access online\u0027 through algorithms that highlight some information, favor certain websites, and even omit some sites altogether. As a result, they can \u0027deter[] market entry in areas that would benefit consumers and damage[e] potential entrants.\u0027 Just as search engines dominate the selection of winners and losers on the Internet, one search engine in particular—Google’s—dominates the search engine market.\"\nAnd the Competitive Enterprise Institute told the FCC that \"one could just as credibly—that is, perversely—make a case for \u0027Search Neutrality\u0027 (All search results shall appear first!).\" (No, we don\u0027t have any idea what that last jab means, either.)\nWhat does it mean?\nThe whole idea of search neutrality remains murky (though net neutrality\u0027s opponents often level the same charge at that idea). Search algorithms, by definition, aren\u0027t \"neutral\"—it\u0027s not even clear what \"neutral\" would mean in such a situation. The algorithms are designed to assign value and then discriminate based on that value to produce a list of relevant results. Being discriminatory is the entire point of the exercise.\nSearch neutrality proponents, though, want to see more transparency about how such algorithms work. And, even if the algorithms are necessarily subjective descriptors of relevance and value, they can at least be applied in a straightforward way (i.e, by not penalizing sites like Foundem and making it unclear how to escape the penalty box).  Others who use the term are concerned about the power of search engines like Google to promote Google\u0027s other services (essentially an antitrust, not a \"search,\" concern; Google has had plenty of these lately). Finally, some ISPs apparently object to the whole practice of Google awarding ads to the highest bidder when they aren\u0027t allowed to squeeze companies like Google for extra cash for extra speed.\nWhat did Odlyzko\u0027s paper conclude about handling this issue? \"For telecommunications, given current trends in demand and in rate and sources of innovation, it appears to be better for society not to tilt towards the operators, and instead to stimulate innovation on the network by others by enforcing net neutrality. But this would likely open the way for other players, such as Google, that emerge from that open and competitive arena as big winners, to become choke points. So it would be wise to prepare to monitor what happens, and be ready to intervene by imposing neutrality rules on them when necessary.\"\nIn other words, apply net neutrality now—but keep search neutrality close at hand.\n","source":"google_52778141428876"}

But after weeks of protracted negotiations with the government in Beijing, it now it appears that the internet\u0027s most powerful company is taking its first concrete steps to withdraw from China.\nJust a few minutes ago, Google\u0027s Chinese search engine - Google.cn - started redirecting to the company\u0027s service Hong Kong , in what seems to be the first major signal of a pullout.\nWhat does that mean? How does it affect the millions of Chinese citizens who use the web on a regular basis? What are people saying on all sides?\nThose are the big questions in this developing story, and we\u0027ll be documenting what it means, how people are reacting - and whether the change is working - here.\n7.24pm: The first indications that the change was happening came in reports overnight , and a statement from US state department official who suggested that Washington was \"aware that there are strong indications of an announcement by Google this afternoon\".\nIn fact, Google started making the changes a short while ago: now the company has now published a lengthy statement on the issue .\n7.28pm: In Google\u0027s statement , the company said it is now sending Chinese users to the Hong Kong service - which, thanks to its unique cultural and political history - is not censored by the government for political content.\n\"Earlier today we stopped censoring our search servicesâ€”Google Search, Google News, and Google Imagesâ€”on Google.cn. Users visiting Google.cn are now being redirected to Google.com.hk, where we are offering uncensored search in simplified Chinese, specifically designed for users in mainland China and delivered via our servers in Hong Kong. Users in Hong Kong will continue to receive their existing uncensored, traditional Chinese service, also from Google.com.hk.\"\n7.30pm: What does that actually mean for users in China? Well, for starters the Hong Kong service seems totally uncensored. I\u0027ve just gone to google.com.hk and looked up å…­å››äº‹ä»¶ - June 4th incident, as the Tiananmen Square massacre is referred to. The first result is this Wikipedia entry , which prominently features a picture of the famous \"tank man\" confronting a column of soldiers holding only a bag of shopping.\nNot much in the way of punches being pulled there.\nThe question is how the Chinese government reacts. Will Chinese users outside Hong Kong be able to see these results?\n7.39pm: Google\u0027s statement says it has \"been hard\" working out how to stop censoring search.\n\"We want as many people in the world as possible to have access to our services, including users in mainland China, yet the Chinese government has been crystal clear throughout our discussions that self-censorship is a non-negotiable legal requirement,\" it says.\nIt says the result is \"entirely legal\" and that company officials \"very much hope that the Chinese government respects our decision\".\nIt also points out that Google has no intention of dropping its research and development operations in China and will maintain a sales team in the country - though it admits that the size of that team depends on whether Chinese citizens can access google.com.hk.\n\"Finally, we would like to make clear that all these decisions have been driven and implemented by our executives in the United States, and that none of our employees in China can, or should, be held responsible for them. Despite all the uncertainty and difficulties they have faced since we made our announcement in January, they have continued to focus on serving our Chinese users and customers. We are immensely proud of them.\"\n7.42pm: Google\u0027s move comes just hours after a group of angry Chinese citizens wrote an open letter addressed to the government and to Google asking them to reconcile their differences so that ordinary web users are not blocked from accessing useful online services.\n\"If Google.cn were to no longer exist, or if China were to further block other Google services, has the Chinese government considered how their blocking of foreign websites and censorship of domestic websites violates Chinese citizens\u0027 right to scientific, educational, environmental, clean energy and other information?\" it says.\nThe letter also asks for greater transparency to help the public and businesses operating in China to understand the rules of censorship.\n\"We support necessary censorship of internet content and communications, whether it is on Google or any other foreign or domestic company,\" it said.\nBut, it adds, understanding exactly what it is that the government wants is the only sensible way to allow companies to comply.\n7.48pm: As Caroline Davies reports, the change could affect up to 340m Chinese citizens , the world\u0027s largest single population of web users.\nWhat impact will this have on Google\u0027s business? Unlike the rest of the world, where it is the dominant force in web search, the Californian company can only boast around a third of the Chinese market (it falls behind Baidu . My feeling is that we\u0027re going to see a lot of speculation as to whether this hinders Google\u0027s long-term success.\n7.52pm: In the comments, user Shanghainese - presumably in Shanghai - says the Hong Kong Google site is blocked .\n\"Are you writing this from within China? I\u0027m guessing not. I just tried the same search for the certain incident you mention on the hk site and got an error page. Google won\u0027t load at all for me now.\"\nAs pointed out, I am writing this from San Francisco (see my name at the top of the article) but our correspondent in Beijing is trying to find out what is and isn\u0027t filtered for her. The government\u0027s application of internet filtering is notoriously spotty, often left to local law enforcement agents so that blocks vary wildly from city to city.\n8.04pm: I\u0027ve just been talking with our Beijing office, who say that the veil of censorship has not disappeared - even though there is some access to the Hong Kong service.\nDan Chung, the Guardian photographer who works out of China, says that \"some searches are blocked, as you would expect\".\n8.09pm: Reaction so far is a little muted - not least because it\u0027s still unclear what this move means - but the general consensus seems to be that Google is doing the right thing by following through on its threat.\nIn the comments, Madridophile says \"it seems like this was absolutely the right thing to do, at least for now\", while jhb15 captures quite a lot of public sentiment by saying that \"I didn\u0027t think they were serious when it was in the news before\".\nOver on Twitter, it\u0027s much the same. \"Good for them,\" says @RiskMgmt . \"Dignity \u003e profits\". @Spencerstweets calls it \"bold\", but @JussiAhlroth is sceptical: \"Don\u0027t be silly and think this is about ethics\".\n8.15pm: So how much is this move going to cost Google exactly? Nobody is sure,\nAccording to Enders Analysis, Google.cn takes about 20% of the money from paid search advertising in China, which is a little bit lower than its market share. That might not seem like a vast amount, but when you\u0027re talking about a business as large as online advertising it\u0027s hardly pocket change.\n\"We estimate the revenue foregone over 2010-15 from closing Google.cn to be between $2-4bn,\" say Alice Enders and Ian Maude in a note that arrived by email.\nWhile two billion dollars is nothing to be sneezed at, it\u0027s not a great deal of money for Google - which is making money hand over fist at the moment. Basically, it puts the five-year cost of dropping out of China somewhere between 8.5% and 17% of the money it made last year alone.\nPerhaps the biggest cost could be in the lost opportunity, or the amount of money the company has sunk into establishing itself in China, says Enders.\n8.25pm: Not in China but want to know what it\u0027s like to surf the web there? ChinaChannel , a plug-in for the Firefox web browser, lets you see.\nOn the other hand, Google also runs a status board for its various services - right now, it says that YouTube and Blogger are entirely blocked in China, while photo application Picasa and document-sharing service Google Docs have some problems.\n8.40pm: Looks like those reports that the Chinese government is still blocking are accurate. Tania Branigan, our China correspondent in Beijing, has the following to say:\n\"Initial tests suggested that the Chinese government\u0027s own filtering system will stop mainland users from seeing the results of many sensitive searches in any case.\"\n\"And while google.cn now redirects visitors to google.com.hk, the Chinese government\u0027s own internet filtering system â€“ \"the Great Firewall\" â€“ prevented results from being returned when searches were conducted using sensitive words and phrases.\"\n\"The use of English and Chinese phrases such as \"Tiananmen Square 1989\" on google.com.hk  resulted in the internet connection being reset.\n8.46pm: Considered reactions are starting to come in.\nThe Center for Democracy and Technology , a non-profit group based in Washington that pushes for an open internet, said that Google was doing the right thing .\n\"CDT applauds Google for following through on its commitment to protect human rights and for its continued effort to enable China\u0027s people with unfiltered access to robust sources of information from all over the world,\" said Leslie Harris, the group\u0027s president and CEO.\n\"Whether the Chinese people will be able to take advantage of Google search now rests squarely with the Chinese government.  If China allows access to unfiltered search, it will be a substantial win for global Internet freedom and for the Chinese people.  If China blocks access, it will finally make clear to the Chinese people who is pulling the levers of censorship in the country.\"\n8.52pm: Meanwhile, the Committee to Protect Journalists, which has lobbied for greater access to information in China, said it was a useful step for pushing Beijing in the right direction.\n\"We welcome this stand against censorship and hope that all Internet companies operating in China take a similar principled position,\" said CPJ Deputy Director Robert Mahoney.\n\"Google\u0027s decision to stop censoring search results will put Google on the wrong side of the Great Firewall. In the long run, however, we hope that it ramps up pressure on the Chinese government to allow its citizens to access the news and information they need to be informed and engaged citizens.\"\n9.03pm: Some more sceptical messages coming through, as people wonder whether Google is trying to make the best situation out of a decision to pull out of a market that it was getting beaten in.\nWell, here\u0027s some more on the business side of things: American financial analysts Jeffries \u0026 Company says that while the move may not cost it a huge amount in the first instance, it is almost certain to be a long-term negative:\n\"China today has the world\u0027s largest internet user base and one of the fastest-growing commerce markets. We believe that Google captures around 30% of China\u0027s traffic, making China the second-largest traffic-generating country for Google behind the US. Shutting down Google.cn, which we estimate generates 80% of the total China traffic, would be a strategic loss for the company.\"\nGoogle\u0027s dominant position elsewhere in the world could buy it some breathing room, however:\n\"That said, exiting China would not be too damaging for Google, since the company is the market share leader in most non-domestic markets, where search usage and monetisation opportunities still abound.\"\n9.15pm: More noises from the human rights community, this time from Index on Censorship , who asked Google\u0027s UK spokesman, Peter Barron , what was going on. His succinct response:\n\"It was clear that if we stopped censorship on Google.cn we wouldn\u0027t be operating within Chinese law â€” so we redirected to our Hong Kong servers which are not subject to Chinese censorship law.\"\nAs mentioned previously, that\u0027s very different from lifting the censorship altogether: Google is hoping that it can still serve from inside the Chinese state - albeit a corner that has previously had more lax censorship.\nBut to all intents and purposes, Beijing treats Hong Kong as a foreign outpost. And if a Chinese surfer tries to visit a controversial site in Britain or the US, they are blocked. Is it any different when the internet routes through Hong Kong?\n9.34pm: I spoke briefly to somebody at Google who pointed out that the company runs a number of other web services in the country beyond search. Most of those are still in operation, despite this tangle with Beijing, and it\u0027s unclear how these are affected in the longer term.\nWill the Chinese government block them, too?\n9.46pm: Now Chinese officials are starting to react.\nIn an article from Xinhua , the state media service, a senior official lets rip, calling out Google for breaking the rules.\n\"Google has violated its written promise it made when entering the Chinese market by stopping filtering its searching service and blaming China in insinuation for alleged hacker attacks,\" Xinhua quotes the official as saying.\n\"This is totally wrong. We\u0027re uncompromisingly opposed to the politicization of commercial issues, and express our discontent and indignation to Google for its unreasonable accusations and conducts.\"\n9.53pm:Here\u0027s a video report from our team in Beijing.\n10.16pm: In our report from Tania in Beijing , she points out that the timing of the news seems timed to catch Chinese officials on the hop.\n\"The announcement came at 3am in China, meaning that there has been no response from officials as yet. Rebecca MacKinnon, visiting fellow at Princeton\u0027s Centre for Information Technology Policy, said: \"It appears they are not doing anything that violates Chinese law â€“ google.cn has ceased to exist. What they are doing in Hong Kong is in bounds of the law there.\"\"\n10.57pm: Sorry for the radio silence: I was writing a piece that we\u0027ll publish shortly about some of the internal conflict at Google ahead of this decision.\nI\u0027m not the only one who\u0027s been bashing his keyboard into oblivion: search blogger Danny Sullivan - one of the most respected names in the Google-watching business - has posted his thoughts on what this means .\nHe calls Google\u0027s shuffle an attempt to perform an \"end run\" on the Chinese government, and isn\u0027t sure that it would succeed.\n\"By moving to a Hong Kong domain â€” which is run under Hong Kong law â€” Google seems to believe that it can do an end-run around Chinese censorship requirements. Google has run a Chinese-aimed uncensored search service on that domain for several years without being blocked. Now it believes it can send everyone in China to that domain and meet Chinese law.\"\n11.22pm: In a brief interview with the New York Times, Google co-founder Sergey Brin explains a little bit about the move .\nMost intriguingly he says that the switch to Hong Kong - which I\u0027ve been told was a compromise agreement negotiated between the two sides as a way to avoid the internet equivalent of nuclear warfare - was never actually given the go-ahead by Beijing.\nThe shift of its Chinese service to Hong Kong, Mr. Brin said, was not given a clear-cut stamp of approval by Beijing. But he said there was a \"back and forth\" with the Chinese government on what to do. \"There was a sense that Hong Kong was the right step,\" Mr. Brin said.\"\n11.30pm: It\u0027s still only 7.30am in Beijing, so Chinese web users are only just starting to wake up to the situation. The press there is unlikely to give Google much love, however: the past few days has seen the intensity of media attacks on the company increase.\nThis Reuters report details some of the allegations: that Google is a foreign company interfering in Chinese business, exporting its values unfairly and undermining the authority of the government. It\u0027s using political tricks , according to China Daily.\nWhatever the case, it\u0027s as much a hot topic there as it is elsewhere and should generate plenty of interest as the day goes on. To keep you going in the meantime, here\u0027s a picture of a Google China security guard trying to hold a small gaggle of journalists at bay.\n11.42pm: Time for some context. I\u0027ll start by showing you through a number of articles we\u0027ve published - you can always find more at our Google+China page.\nThe first news came in the middle of January, when Google revealed it had been attacked . It soon turned out that plenty of other companies were victims too, and the hunt was on.\nStill, Hillary Clinton went on the warpath and lashed out at Chinese censorship online , a stance which officials said could damage diplomatic relations . Meanwhile, at the end of January, Bill Gates stirred the pot by suggesting that censorship efforts there were \"very limited\".\nIn February, Google linked up with the US National Security Agency , one of its old foes, to look further into the origins. But when the New York Times reported that the attacks could be traced to two Chinese schools , a source from one of those accused told us that it was unlikely.\n12.01am: For a sense of severe China\u0027s feelings towards Google are at the moment, it\u0027s worth taking a look at this piece from AFP , which points out the suggestion that Google is linked to the US intelligence services.\nThere is of course, a long history of mistrust between all sides here - going back centuries.\nIndeed, writing on Salon, Andrew Leonard makes the point that moving to Hong Kong taps into a deep vein dislike that goes back to the opium wars:\n\"If Google wanted purposefully to adopt the mantle of the Britain\u0027s most notorious symbol of colonially arrogant capitalism, it could have done no better than to announce it was setting up shop in Hong Kong, there to broadcast its search results to all and sundry.\"\nMeanwhile Tom Foremski at Silicon Valley Watch makes a similar point, before suggesting that \"I like Google\u0027s stand against internet censorship but its dealings with China have become very messy\" .\n12.10am: Rebecca Mackinnon sums up the situation as it stands - though, as she points out, it is only the insomniacs who were active during the night in China.\n\"The ball is now in the Chinese government\u0027s court in two ways,\" she says. \"Whether they will block all of google.com.hk, which until now has not been blocked [and] whether they allow Google to retain its ad sales and R\u0026D businesses in China\".\nIndex on Censorship has also published an interview she conducted with Google\u0027s legal chief, David Drummond several months ago that is worth reading.\n12.23am: So here\u0027s where things currently stand:\nGoogle has redirected its google.cn search engine to the uncensored equivalent in Hong Kong . That site, which like all sites in Hong Kong is basically considered to be foreign, is subject to the usual filtering by the Great Firewall. This means that Chinese surfers may see controversial listings in their results - but they can\u0027t actually see the blocked pages themselves.\nGoogle seems to suggest that it has discussed this solution with China, and hopes that it works - but the Chinese do not seem pleased with this answer . In the meantime, however, this effectively puts Google back to where it was in 2006, before it launched a censored version of the search index.\nExcept now the internet\u0027s most powerful company has upset Beijing, angered millions of people and taken four years to decide that censoring search contravenes its \"don\u0027t be evil\" policy.\nI\u0027m signing off for a little bit. We\u0027ll be back when there\u0027s more response to add.\n5.10am: It\u0027s now early morning in Britain, lunchtime in China and the night is drawing to a close here in San Francisco - so just time for a few updates before I sign off.\nFirst of all, here\u0027s my background piece on how this all blew up - looking at how Google got to this point, and how the internal politics at the company has left it on the brink with the Chinese government.\nImportant things to note:\n• There is a rift inside Google about how to deal with this issue that has been around for a long time, and Eric Schmidt - the chief executive - seems to have been on the losing side.\n• Google went ahead with this plan because it let them try and win without giving up on its ideals entirely. Except, as Sergey Brin has admitted , it did not know exactly how the Chinese government would respond.\n• And it turns out Beijing has strongly condemned this move . Ouch.\nThe ripples are starting to spread.\n5.21am: What seems to be developing is a basic split between the story as it appears inside and outside Chinese borders. Inside China, the entire situation is being played down. Looking at the front page of the news sites, this story isn\u0027t even mentioned. But outside China, everyone is lining up to pat Google on the back.\nThat includes scads of human rights groups , such as Amnesty, whose director, Kate Allen, said: \"Amnesty has consistently called on companies operating in China to stop collaborating with the Chinese authorities\u0027 censorship requirements, and to respect the right to freedom of expression for web users in China. It\u0027s very welcome news that Google appears to be moving back towards these principles. This now lays down the gauntlet to other internet companies operating in China.\"\n5.32am: There\u0027s some interesting discussion going on in the comments: feel free to chip in if you\u0027ve got something to add. So far reaction seems divided between those who think Google\u0027s doing the right thing (a majority) and those who think it\u0027s serving itself and is making a business decision.\nOne point I wanted to pick up, from user tteng that relates to the split between the company\u0027s founders and the chief executive that I mentioned earlier.\n\"Google\u0027s charter guarantees that its co-founders will never be removed of their positions by its board, thus Mr Brin can afford to make decision based on his belief, not necessarily on company\u0027s bottom line.\"\nThat\u0027s true. Ttseng goes on:\n\"As happened, Google has already been punished by the US stock-market after its January statement. In this instance, Google is making a moral choice at the expense of its stock holders.\"\nThat\u0027s not quite true. While Google did experience a drop in its share price on the news about China in January (and is down around 0.5% today), it is very hard to argue that it is being punished by the market. Here\u0027s a graph of Google\u0027s stock price over the past five years:\nGoogle stock prices from 2005-2010\nAs you can see, it\u0027s taken a bit of a dip since it reached a high in October 2008. But it\u0027s recent travails have had a pretty minimal impact on the share price.\n5.36am: As mentioned earlier, not every Google service has closed in mainland China. It\u0027s largely hitting web search and news (which covers the vast majority of Google\u0027s traffic). However, the block doesn\u0027t seem to cover everything: SF Weekly reports that uncensored results are available on Google\u0027s mobile site .\nThat\u0027s an indication that the Great Firewall isn\u0027t blanketing everything - though, of course, this is subject to change.\n5.40am: The AFP is now reporting that Washington officials are \"disappointed\" that Google did not come to an agreement with China , in what sounds a little like a step back from the strong rhetoric of recent months.\n\"We are disappointed that Google and the Chinese government were unable to reach an agreement that would allow Google to continue operating its search services in China on its Google.cn website,\" the story quotes National Security Council spokesman Mike Hammer as saying.\nHammer added that relations between the two countries were \"mature enough to sustain differences.\"\n5.47am: China Daily - which is reporting Xinhua\u0027s line on the government\u0027s response - is also dredging up the details of a copyright spat with Chinese authors.\nMeanwhile Li Ka-Shing, the Hong Kong billionaire who owns one of China\u0027s most important websites, Tom, has cancelled a deal for Google to supply web search , according to BusinessWeek. No surprise really - after all, if the government is blocking search results, Tom is only get a part of the service. But it\u0027s a blow nonetheless.\n5.50am: I\u0027m signing off now, but I\u0027ll give the last word to foreign relations expert Minxin Pei , who argues that Google has simply run into the enormous machinery of the Chinese state and had the misfortune to have \"committed a double offense\" along the way.\n\"Its search technology poses a clear and present threat to the party\u0027s regime security, while its capacity to dominate the Internet search business would deprive China of its own national champion, Baidu (which, although a private business, is easier to control).\"\n\"Google\u0027s senior management may have learned a thing or two about dealing with a one-party regime through its unhappy foray into China. It\u0027s unclear, though, whether other Western firms have learned anything at all at Google\u0027s expense.\"\n","source":"google_52778141428876"}

The topic, as it so often seems to be these days, is what can be done to save journalism?  Since Rupert Murdoch was scheduled to address the conference a little before me, I thought this would be a good time to take a look at Murdoch\u0027s increasingly bellicose war against new media sites that aggregate the news, the increasingly desperate revenue models being discussed for online news, and what, in fact, needs to be done to ensure that journalism will not only survive, but thrive.\nI. Desperate Times Lead to... Desperate Metaphors\nEver since we decided to launch the Huffington Post, I\u0027ve talked about how the future of journalism will be a hybrid future where traditional media players embrace the ways of new media (including transparency, interactivity, and immediacy) and new media companies adopt the best practices of old media (including fairness, accuracy, and high-impact investigative journalism).\nAnd with so many traditional media companies adapting to the new realities, it was ridiculous to engage in an us vs. them, old media vs. new media argument. Either/or was the wrong way to look at things.\nBut playing nice has increasingly become a one-way street -- suddenly the air is filled with shrill, nonsensical, and misplaced verbal assaults on those in the new media.\nApparently, some in the old media have decided that it is, in fact, an either/or game and that the best way to save, if not journalism, at least themselves, is by pointing fingers and calling names. It\u0027s a tactic familiar to schoolyard inhabitants everywhere: when all else fails, reach for the nearest insult and throw it around indiscriminately.\nSo now sites that aggregate the news have become, in the words of Rupert Murdoch and his team, \" parasites ,\" \" content kleptomaniacs ,\" \" vampires ,\" \" tech tapeworms in the intestines of the Internets ,\" and, of course, thieves who \" steal all our copyright .\"\nIt\u0027s the news industry equivalent of \"your mama wears army boots!\"  Although, not quite as persuasive.\nIn most industries, if your customers were leaving in droves, you would try to figure out what to do to get them back. Not in the media. They\u0027d rather accuse aggregators of stealing their content.\nOf course, any site can shut down the indexing of its content by Google any time it wants with a simple \"disallow\" in its robots.txt file.  But be careful what you wish for because as soon as you do that, and start denying your content to other sites that aggregate and link back to the original source, you stand to lose a large part of your traffic overnight.  But as they say in Australia: \"Good on ya.\" Of course as someone who cares deeply about the future of this country, I\u0027d say that having Glenn Beck not searchable by Google is an entirely good thing. But a good business move? Not so much.\nThinking that removing your content from Google will somehow keep it \"exclusive\" shows a fundamental lack of understanding of the web and how it works.  As an experiment, Google the key terms from any interesting story currently kept behind a paywall, on the Wall Street Journal, for instance.  And imagine no News Corp. source being included in the search results.  You\u0027d still get dozens and dozens of links to other sources -- including many of the biggest news sites -- writing about the story, riffing on it, quoting from it, and commenting on the key facts in it.  So what are you going to do, try to make the case that no one should be able to talk about or write about or comment on or report on the stories you make them pay for? It\u0027s a ridiculous notion.\nI was recently on a panel in Monaco with Mathias Döpfner, CEO of the German publisher Axel Springer. He decided to play a confusing metaphor game by comparing news content to beer. \"If it\u0027s your business decision to offer beer cans for free, fine,\" he said. \"But don\u0027t take our beer and offer it for free.\"\nThis struck me as a really bizarre metaphor. Information is hardly the same thing as a product that can only be consumed once by a single person. If you consume a news story, you might be one of millions. If you consume a beer, no one else can consume it.\nSo it\u0027s a false metaphor. And if you start from a false premise, you will inevitably be led to a false conclusion. Or, to put it another way, if you chug-a-lug too many of old media\u0027s metaphoric beers, you will end up staggering down the street of illogical thinking and banging into the lamp post of wrong revenue models.\nIn his speech this morning, Rupert Murdoch confused aggregation with wholesale misappropriation.  Wholesale misappropriation is against the law -- and he has legal redress against that already.  Aggregation, on the other hand, within the fair use exceptions to copyright law is part of the web\u0027s DNA.  Period.\nAt HuffPost, aggregation goes along with a tremendous amount of original content including original reporting and over 250 original blog posts a day.  And we love it when someone links to one of our posts, or excerpts a small amount and links back to us.\nMost sites understand the value of this and the way the link economy operates. It\u0027s why HuffPost gets hundreds of requests from news outlets asking us to feature their material and link back to their site. They understand that the web is not a zero-sum game and that consumers love the freedom to be able to follow where their interests -- and the offshoots of a story -- take them.\nPlus, let\u0027s be honest, many of those complaining the loudest are working both sides of the street. Take, for example, Rupert Murdoch\u0027s News Corp.  Just look at the sites News Corp. owns, as TechDirt.com recently did , and you will see example after example after example of the pot calling the kettle black.  And aggregating its content.\nThe Wall Street Journal has a tech section that\u0027s nothing more than a parasite -- uh, I mean, aggregator -- of outside content.\nFoxNews.com has a Politics Buzztracker that bloodsucks -- uh, I mean aggregates and links to -- stories from a variety of different sources, including the NY Times, the Washington Post, MSNBC and others.\nAllThingsD has a section called Voices that not only aggregates headlines, but also takes a nice chunk of text -- and puts the links out at the bottom of the story.\nAnd Murdoch\u0027s News Corp. also owns IGN, which has a variety of web properties, including the Rotten Tomatoes movie review aggregation site -- which is entirely made up of movie reviews pulled together from other places. Did someone say \"stealing\"?\nTalk about having your aggregation cake and bitching about others eating a slice too.\nThat\u0027s why I could only roll my eyes when the Wall Street Journal\u0027s Robert Thomson wagged his finger at Google , and complained that it \"encourages promiscuity\" among news consumers.\nHeaven forbid! Let\u0027s be honest, while promiscuity is not good in relationships, it\u0027s great for those looking for news and information. Trying to deny news consumers as wide a range of options and viewpoints as possible seems shortsighted -- and ultimately self-defeating. This is a Golden Age for news consumers who can surf the net, use search engines, access the best stories from around the world, and be able to comment, interact, and form communities. The value of having the world of information at your fingertips is beyond dispute.\nSo it\u0027s time for traditional media companies to stop whining and face the fact that far too many of them, lulled by a lack of competition and years of pretax profits of 20 percent or more, put cash flow above journalism and badly misread the web when it arrived on the scene.  The focus was on consolidation, cost-cutting, and pleasing Wall Street -- not modernization and pleasing their readers.\nThey were asleep at the wheel, missed the writing on the wall, let the train leave the station, let the ship sail -- pick your metaphor -- and quickly found themselves on the wrong side of the disruptive innovation the Internet and new media represent.  And now they want to call timeout, ask for a do-over, start changing the rules, lobby the government to bail them out, and attack the new media for being... well, new. And different. And transformational.  Suddenly it\u0027s all about thievery and parasites and intestines.\nGet real, you guys. The world has changed. Here are some facts culled from one of the most popular anthems to the impact of technology on our world, a video originally put together by a math teacher, Karl Fisch:\nDid you know that newspaper circulation is down 7 million over the last 25 years while unique readership of online news is up 34 million in the last 5 years?\nDid you know newspaper advertising fell nearly 19 percent this year while web advertising is up 9 percent and mobile advertising is up 18 percent?\nDid you know that more video was uploaded to YouTube in the last 2 months than if ABC, CBS, and NBC had been airing all-new content every minute of every day since 1948?\nAnd did you know that we have access to more than 1 trillion web pages, 100,000 iPhone apps, and send more text messages a day than there are people on the planet? And Rupert Murdoch still thinks aggregators are the problem?\nWe\u0027re not in Kansas anymore, Toto. And some things are better while some things, for the moment, are worse in terms of upheaval and especially the painful loss of jobs. But this is unarguably a Brave New Media World. And there is no use living in digital denial.\nThe information superhighway is a busy thoroughfare and there\u0027s going to be some road kill along the way. But only among those who insist on merging into traffic riding a horse and buggy.\nII. Desperate Times Lead To... Desperate Revenue Models!\nPractically every day now, we hear about a new initiative designed to \"harness digital media\" and \"get people to pay for their news on the web.\"\nThe big buzz last week was about News Corp.\u0027s fantasies of breaking up with Google and tying the knot with Microsoft, giving its heart -- and all its content -- to Bing. I\u0027ll gladly wager my share of the Huffington Post that this ain\u0027t gonna happen.\nThe charge-for-content crowd seems to change strategies as often as Lindsay Lohan switches meds. First paywalls were going to be the answer. Then it was micro-payments.  Then per article purchases. Then day passes.\nJames Harding, editor of the London Times and a member of Team Murdoch, recently said that he preferred the idea of charging for 24-hour access to his paper\u0027s website over the use of micro-payments, which he fears could lead to newspapers, and I quote, \"writing a lot more about Britney Spears and a lot less about Tamils in northern Sri Lanka.\" For those of you up on Britney but not on the Tamils, they were on the losing side of the Sri Lankan civil war.\nIn any case, only 3 percent of consumers say they prefer the micro-payment method. But, hey, who cares what they prefer... they are only consumers!\nNow, James Harding is a really nice, really smart guy and Times Online is a really great site, but, seriously, on what grounds would a reader decide that on any particular day instead of surfing around the web, clicking on the stories they find interesting, snacking, sampling, and moving on -- or digging deeper by following a link -- they are going to purchase a 24-hour pass to every bit of content on just one single site? Is it because, of course you fool, Tuesdays at the Times are always so much newsier than everywhere else? Or will readers save their money until Thursdays and pay for The Sun because they have more boobs and bottoms that day? I mean, Tamils in Sri Lanka.\nMeanwhile, Stephen Brill\u0027s Journalism Online reportedly has 16 different payment schemes that it plans to offer its member publishers. Nieman Lab recently listed six payment models that Brill has trademarked, and that news publishers can employ.\nThese include:  High activity Pay Points (a metered model); Selected Content Pay Points (a partial paywall); Time-based Pay Points (charging for new content only); Enhanced Service Pay Points (charging for special features); Market Access Pay Points (charges based on a users location); and Preview Activity Pay Points (allowing previewing of paid content).\nIn other words, it\u0027s payment made simple!\nOr take the New York Times.  A quick search of headlines in the business press shows that in the summer of 2009 it was, \" New York Times Company CEO Confirms Likelihood of Paywall for NYT Content by Autumn .\"  By September that had become: \" New York Times Paywall Decision to Be \u0027Gut Call .\u0027  By November it had become: \" New York Times Paywall Decision Coming Within Weeks .\"\nIt amazes me that Murdoch and Brill and the Paywall Team at the Times continue to believe that people are prepared to pay for news online -- despite the recent survey showing that 80 percent of U.S. news consumers say they \"wouldn\u0027t bother\" to read news and magazines online if the content were no longer free.\nSure, free news content is not a perfect system but it\u0027s a lot like what Churchill said about democracy: it \"is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried.\" That\u0027s the reality.  Free content is not without problems.  But it\u0027s here to stay, and publishers need to come to terms with that and figure out how to make it work for them.\nAnd all across the country, passionate entrepreneurs are doing just that, experimenting with new and creative revenue models. TechDirt.com is monetizing its engaged and highly informed community by turning them into focus-groups-for-hire. ProPublica is using a not-for-profit model to produce impact investigative journalism. And there are many different powerful local journalism models, including Voice of San Diego , which supports its award-winning local journalism with a combination of advertising and public radio-style contributions from foundations and users.\nThe new paths to success are still being charted -- and much remains uncertain. But this much is clear: we can\u0027t use an analog map and expect to find our way in a digital word.\nIII. Desperate Times Desperately Call For Better Journalism\nHere is what we must not forget: our current media culture (with a few honorable exceptions) failed to serve the public interest by missing the two biggest stories of our time -- the run-up to the war in Iraq and the financial meltdown. In both instances, there were plenty of people who got it right, who saw what was coming and warned about it, but they weren\u0027t given much of a voice or were drowned out by the thumping sound of journalists walking in lockstep.\nAs a result, we\u0027ve had far too many autopsies of what went wrong and not enough biopsies of what was about to go wrong. Many important stories have died on the front pages of newspapers. Online media, on the other hand, are particularly well-suited to obsessively follow a story until it breaks through the static.  When new media journalists decide that something matters, they chomp down hard and refuse to let go. They\u0027re the true pit bulls of reporting.\nWe hear lots and lots of talk these days about saving newspapers -- Congressional anti-trust exemptions, perhaps? -- but we mustn\u0027t forget: the state of newspapers is not the same thing as the state of journalism. As much as I love newspapers -- and fully expect them to survive -- the future of journalism is not dependent on the future of newspapers.\nIndeed, the future of journalism is to be found, at least partly, in the rapidly growing number of people who connect with the news in a whole new way.\nNews is no longer something we passively take in. We now engage with news, react to news and share news. It\u0027s become something around which we gather, connect and converse. We all are part of the evolution of a story now -- expanding it with comments and links to relevant information, adding facts and differing points of view.\nIn short, the news has become social. And it will become even more community-powered: stories will be collaboratively produced by editors and the community. And conversations, opinion, and reader reactions will be seamlessly integrated into the news experience.\nWe saw the power of citizen journalism during the uprising earlier this year in Iran. People tweeting from demonstrations and uploading video of brutal violence taken with their camera phones were able to tell a story, in real-time, and circumvent the efforts of the regime to control the media and the flow of information.\nIn fact, the new paradigm was illustrated perfectly by the New York Times, which covered the story both in the old way and the new way. The former came by way of executive editor Bill Keller who was in Tehran for the election.  Three days after the fraudulent vote, and well after the street protests had been revved up and hundreds of videos had been uploaded and thousands of tweets had been posted, he reported: \"With this election, Mr. Khamenei and [Mr. Ahmadinejad] appear to have neutralized for now the reform forces that they saw as a threat to their power, political analysts said.\"\nUh, not exactly.\nAt the same time, the Times also ran an aggregation blog by Robert Mackey that was, like the terrific one our national editor Nico Pitney did on HuffPost , a 24/7 nerve center of updates, video and tweets -- largely by citizen journalists.\nCitizen journalists can play a key role in investigative journalism. At the Huffington Post, they help shape our stories in multiple ways -- from whistleblowing to combing through thousands of pages of bills and government documents to being part of our Bearing Witness 2.0 project, finding great stories from across the country that put flesh and blood on the statistics and consequences of our economic crisis.\nAnd yet the contributions of citizen journalists, bloggers, and others who aren\u0027t paid to cover the news are constantly mocked and derided by the critics of new media who clearly don\u0027t understand that technology has enabled millions of consumers to shift their focus from passive observation to active participation -- from couch potato to self-expression. Writing blogs, sending tweets, updating your Facebook page, editing photos, uploading videos, and making music are just a few of the active entertainment options now available. But when the data began to show a significant shift in consumer habits, traditional media responded by belittling web journalism.\nThe same people who never question why consumers would sit on a couch and watch TV for 8 hours straight can\u0027t understand why someone would find it rewarding to weigh in on the issues -- great and small -- that interest them. For free. They don\u0027t understand the people who contribute to Wikipedia for free, who maintain their own blogs for free, who Twitter for free, who constantly refresh and update their Facebook page for free, who want to help tell the stories of what is happening in their lives and in their communities... for free.\nAt the Huffington Post, and at the Huffington Post Investigative Fund, we deeply value the role of professional reporters and editors, and have dozens of them on payroll. And we think the value of editors will only increase as the constant stream of information coming at us continues to swell -- making trusted guides and curators more and more essential to keeping us from being swept away.\nBut there is no denying that thousands and thousands of other people want in on the process and have much to contribute to it.  And that number will only continue to grow.  To deride the value of their contributions is to completely misunderstand the world we live in.\nAnd the sooner we all embrace that world, the sooner we\u0027ll be able to stop the name calling, put aside the increasingly desperate metaphors and increasingly desperate revenue models, and focus on what really matters: ensuring that in the future, journalism will not only survive, but be strengthened and thrive.\n \nThis Blogger\u0027s Books from\n","source":"google_52778141428876"}

This season\u0027s based off of the first half of George R.R. Martin\u0027s third \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" book, \"A Storm of Swords,\" which comes with its own unofficial tagline—\"I hope that wasn\u0027t your favorite character.\"\nMartin, like other show creators with devoted fandoms (Steven Moffat, Julian Fellowes, looking right at you), is as fond of killing off characters as he is at introducing them. \"A Storm of Swords\" might be his most momentous volume out of the five currently out, and there are several key events during the course of this novel that create narratives thick with turmoil and uncertainty that will haunt many of the characters long after those events are over.\nHowever, that could really be said about any of the ASoIaF books.\nNone of that particular brand of \"What just HAPPENED\" was on full display during the season 3 premiere, \"Valar Dohaeris,\" but despite its relatively mellow pacing, this first episode sets up the baseline tensions that will explode as the season continues.\nBefore we even begin to talk about what happened in the episode, what\u0027s up with the title? We all know that Jaqen H\u0027ghar (aka the hot assassin who swapped out his face before peacing out last season) told Arya Stark to use the phrase \"Valar morghulis\" to reach him. \nA quick Google search (or, if you\u0027re like this writer, reading the books) reveals that the phrase means \"All men must die.\" \"Valar dohaeris\" is the polite(?) response to such a phrase, and it means \"All men must serve.\" Pretty sure the show hasn\u0027t defined these phrases yet, but then again, that\u0027s what Google is for. And besides, the show\u0027s taking some shortcuts even as it tries to stay true to the book narratives.\nMore on that later.\nSeason 3\u0027s premiere starts with a scream and ends with an early reveal. Let\u0027s break it down, storyline by storyline:\nSamwell Tarly, best man in the Night\u0027s Watch. (via tessalovespandas/Tumblr)\nBeyond the Wall, Samwell Tarly becomes the living incarnation of the phrase \"YOU HAD ONE JOB\" when he runs back to the Rangers without having sent off the ravens (see: end of season 2). That said, the look of fear in actor John Bradley\u0027s eyes as an extra from \"The Walking Dead: Ice Road Truckers Edition\" clawed at him was chilling (no pun intended). The undead are up to no good, and while there\u0027s been indications of magical madness from the very start of the show (seriously, remember the first scene of the series), it\u0027s only now that the threat is getting really, well, real.\nMeanwhile, Jon Snow continues being the socially awkward outcast when he 1) mistakes Tormund Giantsbane (speaking of giants: giants!) for King-Beyond-The-Wall Mance Rayder and 2) totally forgets that the wildlings don\u0027t give a rat\u0027s ass about courtesy and convention. Oh, Jon Snow—this is what happens when your only defining point of fame is being Ned Stark\u0027s bastard. (Someone needs to make a supercut of every character who\u0027s referred to poor Snow as such.) \nReal Talk: by Jon Snow. (via blockosquares/Tumblr)\nStill, \"I want to fight for the side that fights for the living\"? For a double agent, that\u0027s a pretty noble sentiment. It\u0027s not enough perhaps for Rayder to completely trust in this turned Crow, but it\u0027s enough to keep the once-traitor from killing Snow.\nIn the ruins of Harrenhal, Robb and Catelyn Stark survey the terrible toll that the war for the Seven Kingdoms has taken on their forces. Tywin Lannister, if you may recall, left the castle in a hurry (in order to swoop in for the kill during the Battle of the Blackwater, natch), and as a result, he didn\u0027t have time to properly clean house. \nSo, when the Northern forces finally ride into the castle in \"victory,\" they find the courtyard and the parapets littered with bodies—the bodies of Northern and Riverlands prisoners. It\u0027s a sobering sight for Stark(s) and co., and Catelyn realizes just how wrong she was to give away one of her son\u0027s greatest bargaining chips. GoodGal!Talisa goes to help a badly injured man by the name of Qyburn, and tells him he\u0027s lucky to be alive. Yes, because being surrounded by bloody, diseased bodies (and being one yourself) is truly luck of the highest order.\n\"Heyyy guysss.\" (via queenshireen/Tumblr)\nOutside of King\u0027s Landing, Davos Seaworth (the pirate who became the Onion Knight) wakes up from a \"Sleeping Beauty\"-like slumber (minus the crazy blisters) and realizes that oh shit, his king lost. This realization plays out beautifully in a scene in which Seaworth is questioned as to his loyalty, and being a painfully honest man, he answers with the name of his losing king. \nLuckily, he lands back in the hands of his friend Salladhor Saan, but he and Saan have a bit of a falling out concerning the mental stability and options of the in-hiding Stannis Baratheon. Saan argues that the would-be king is unsound and unsafe, but Seaworth is stubborn in his loyalty and demands to be dropped off at Dragonstone.\nWell, he gets his wish, and for his loyalty, Stannis gives him the cold shoulder. Melisandre relishes this victory over the Onion Knight, and though it\u0027s sad to see such a stalwart character get a talking down to, she has a point: If she had been at the battle, who knows how the battle would\u0027ve turned out? Perhaps the Lord of Light, R\u0027hllor, could\u0027ve provided the power to defeat the alchemists and their wildfire. Whatever the case may be, Davos loses his cool and tries to kill the Red Priestess. For that, he\u0027s ordered into the dungeons. Welcome home, Davos. Also, your sons are dead.\nYes, trust the man with the devilish goatee. (via geekized/Tumblr)\nDown in King\u0027s Landing, the politicking is in full swing despite the obvious reconstruction efforts continuing throughout the city. Sansa Stark only has one moment to shine, but the scene with her, Shae, Petyr Baelish, and Baelish\u0027s \"manager\" Ros hints that oh, the fallen queen-to-be\u0027s storyline is far from over. That, and that Baelish is a total creep, but that much has been pretty evident from the beginning of the show.\nAmongst the Lannisters, several different conflicts are in full swing because there ain\u0027t no party like a Lannister treachery party. Cersei and Tyrion continue facing off against each other (or rather, Cersei tries to face off with Tyrion and Tyrion doesn\u0027t give a shit because he\u0027s still dealing with the aftermath of almost having his face slashed off). Bronn continues playing Tyrion\u0027s sidekick, but he reminds the former Hand of the King that their friendship only lasts as long as the coin between them is still good.\nTyrion\u0027s got bigger fish to fry though, and his scene with his father Tywin, the new Hand of the King, is both heartbreaking and blood boiling. Tyrion makes his case for Casterly Rock, the Lannister family\u0027s core holding, and Tywin tears down his son\u0027s claim in a diatribe as honest as it is wrong. \nOut of all of Tywin\u0027s children, Jaime\u0027s sworn to the royal court, Cersei is slowly capital L Losing it; Tyrion\u0027s the only one who\u0027s got it together (well, relatively), and he\u0027s being denied a chance based on his father\u0027s irrational biases? Well, forget that—he basically gives his father the finger when he walks out of the Hand\u0027s (his former) office before Tywin\u0027s finished speaking.\n\"DOES NOT COMPUTE.\" (via jennasavocado/Tumblr)\nSpeaking of the King, how\u0027s Joffrey (#littleshit) doing? He and his new queen, Margaery Tyrell, are heading through the city, when his lady stops at an orphanage to give gifts to the children (and drag her dress through literal shit), and the fear and confusion in Joffrey\u0027s eyes is almost comical. As a fellow viewer said to this writer, \"What is emotion? Does not compute.\" \nIt\u0027d be really hilarious, if we didn\u0027t know that this empathy-lacking little manchild is capable of some really gruesome stuff. But Margaery\u0027s officially won respect points from him, and when Cersei casts her particular brand of cynical charm on Margaery, Joffrey uncharacteristically defends his new queen while simultaneously keeping up his own (untrue) reputation as a regal non-coward. \nOh Cersei. She\u0027s crazy, but imagine being told by your own son that you\u0027re bitter and possibly senile. Of course, she\u0027s probably the only one who recognizes Margaery\u0027s actions for what they are—calculated acts of compassion meant to inspire love of which this city is desperately in need.\nIn case anyone was forgetting, DRAGONS!!! (via screencaps.net)\nAnd then, DRAGONS!!! It\u0027s really amazing how normal (as normal as dragons can be) their growth has been shown in the series, but as the flawlessly coiffed Daenerys Targaryen makes note, they\u0027re not growing fast enough. But she, Ser Jorah Mormont, and her band of loyal (and seasick) Dothraki make their way to the slave city of Astapor. \nThere, Dany gets a look at the means to her ends in the form of the eunuch Unsullied army. In one of the most disgusting moments of the series (and there sure are plenty), one of the slave traders cuts off the nipple of one of the Unsullied, and it\u0027s as unsettling for the viewer as it is for Dany, for no matter how singleminded she is, she\u0027s not aimlessly cruel in her actions. \nIn the last moment of the episode, Dany follows a creepy child and gets an equally creepy gift—surprise scorpion creature manticore attack, anyone?\nThankfully, a cloaked and hooded figure is following her and kills the beast before Dany meets her untimely end. Who\u0027s that to the rescue? None other than the disgraced former leader of the Kingsguard, Ser Barristan Selmy, who asks Dany both for forgiveness (for not keeping her family safe during Robert\u0027s Rebellion) and for a position on her Queensguard. \nThis is one of the major departures from the book series. Selmy\u0027s in disguise as Arstan Whitebeard for a long time before Dany and Jorah learn his true identity, and he\u0027s accompanied by a character named Strong Belwas. It appears that Selmy\u0027s going it alone in the series, and will also be upfront about his identity.\nWhile the season premiere covered a lot of ground (literally—Westeros is a big place), some of this writer\u0027s favorite characters were missing. Where\u0027s the rest of the Stark children, Brienne of Tarth, and the other half of everybody\u0027s favorite incestuous twin couple, Jaime Lannister?\nRest assured, they\u0027ll get their time (and then some), and as this season chugs onward, we\u0027re going to see all of the characters (and plenty of new ones) weave in and out of intertwining storylines with the dexterity characteristic of Shakespeare\u0027s comedies and the outcomes characteristic of the bard\u0027s greatest tragedies.\nReach Music Editor and Thronie Lilian Min here .

S Voice Drive - While S Voice (also featured on the Galaxy S III) takes a cue from both Siri and Google Now, the S Voice Drive is tailor-made ...","text":"Where the Samsung Galaxy S4\u0027s Awesomeness Lies\nElectronicsNewsRx.com\nBy a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Computer Weekly News -- Back in 2011, consumers were initially disappointed when Apple came out with the iPhone 4S instead of the expected iPhone 5. Not that their first reactions were entirely blameless, considering that the 4S and its predecessor (the iPhone 4) do look a lot alike; not to mention the fact that the way the 4S was named called to mind a nominal upgrade (iPhone 4 Special, maybe?) rather than a full-fledged product evolution.\nThen people started to actually use the 4S, and what they found surprised them in a good way. Suffice it to say, naming and appearance aside, the 4S really did step up its hardware, not the least of which included the 1080p camera, the dual-core GPU, and the A5 system-on-chip. Product reception was also bolstered by great software, with Siri and the iOS 5 (as it was meant to be run) being the most prominent.\nFast forward to March of this year, and history really does tend to repeat itself. Samsung finally unveiled its Galaxy S4 to the world, but despite the initial hype, many came away from the event feeling that maybe the company could have done just a bit more.\nDeja Vu... Sort Of\nFor one thing, besides being a little larger and thinner, the new phone looked very similar to the Galaxy S III, having the same rounded edges and a single home button at the bottom.\nFor another, since the Galaxy S III\u0027s success was brought about as much by its software as by its hardware, Samsung sought to go back into the gold mine and bank on software upgrades once again.\nIt also didn\u0027t help that the model names of both the iPhone 4S and the Galaxy S4 sounded alike; a minor point to be sure, but still a point.\nThe circumstances may not have been the same as the iPhone 4S\u0027s launch, but the general audience reception definitely was: The idea that not enough substance was brought to the table. Perhaps the overall reaction was colored somewhat by what has quickly become one of the most awkward (with some even calling it sexist) gadget launches ever, but popular public opinion still remains that the Galaxy S4 is just \"high quantity, low quality\" on upgrades.\nThe Game Changers\n\"I disagree with public opinion, though. I think that if consumers really start to use the Galaxy S4, they\u0027ll find that the new smartphone\u0027s features are more than just gimmicky add-ons,\" states Hathem Brand, writer at CashForSmartphones.com. \"The Galaxy S4\u0027s tagline is \"Life Companion,\" and that to me implies that the phone should be intuitive enough to be there for you wherever you are and in whatever situation you might be in. A human touch, if you will; one that really exemplifies the \"smart\" in \"smartphone.\" While the Galaxy S4\u0027s performance is admittedly still far from machines with human-like behavior we\u0027ve been speculating in sci-fi stories like A.I.: Artificial Intelligence, it\u0027s definitely a huge step in that direction.\"\nThis is in large part due to the various motion and eye sensors that encompass the so-called \"touchless controls.\" Samsung showed a precursor to this with the last Galaxy model\u0027s Smart Stay feature, which detected if a user\u0027s eyes were still fixed on the screen so that it\u0027ll know whether or not to go into sleep mode. The current Galaxy builds upon this by having tilt and motion recognition, as well as further broadening the eye detection functions. More than ever, the phone recognizes you.\nListed below are these touchless controls, along with some of the more awesome features that the Galaxy S4 has:\nAir View - Imagine using your phone in the winter with your gloves on or eating French fries and not wanting to leave unsightly smudge marks on your phone. Now, without having to take off your gloves or wash your hands, the Galaxy S4 is still accessible. You don\u0027t need to touch the phone\u0027s screen anymore. You can just control it using hand swipes in the air.\nSmart Pause - A direct spin-off of the Galaxy S III\u0027s Smart Stay, Smart Pause pauses a video you\u0027re watching when you\u0027re not looking at the screen. This ensures that you don\u0027t miss one second of Bilbo Baggins\u0027s unexpected journey, even if someone needs to get your attention for a bit.\nSmart Scroll - This feature uses both eye-tracking and tilt detection to scroll through pages. This could come in pretty handy when you\u0027re, say, commuting to work on a crowded New York subway, and you have to use one hand to hold on to the overhead railing while using the other hand to read through an online article.\nS Voice Drive - While S Voice (also featured on the Galaxy S III) takes a cue from both Siri and Google Now, the S Voice Drive is tailor-made for in-car use, combining the voice command feature with the phone\u0027s navigation systems.\nWatchON - Using the phone\u0027s IR blaster, this feature allows you to do a number of things in conjunction with your television. For example, you could pull up a list of shows to watch on your TV. Once you\u0027ve made your choice between Game of Thrones or The Walking Dead, you can then use your Galaxy S4 as a remote control; and this is just on non-Samsung TVs.\nWith a Samsung TV, you can do even more nifty things like pulling a show from your TV onto your phone so you can continue watching even if you have to go to another room. Conversely, you can also check out if a movie is available on Netflix (or otherwise stored on the phone), and transfer it to the TV.\nS Translator - This is a translator tool that translates your emails and chats in real time in any desired language. Language barriers (well, popular languages like Chinese and Spanish, at least) won\u0027t be much of an issue anymore.\nS Health - This is useful software that monitors things like your calorie intake and the number of steps you\u0027ve taken. With S Health on, tracking your physical progress while jogging through Central Park will be easier.\nHarbinger of Near-Future Trends\nThe above are just some of the programs that tie in heavily with the aforementioned \"Life Companion\" design philosophy. The phone also has more great features like Group Play (which allows multiple Galaxy S4 users to listen to a song or play multiplayer video games at the same time), the Eraser Shot (which has the ability to erase photobombers cleanly), and Cinema Photo (which can be used to create GIF animations).\nNeedless to say, all these apps strengthen Samsung\u0027s software-focused approach. The company is riding the wave of a very probable near-future that\u0027s dependent on cloud services and - more importantly - \"human-intuitive\" software that caters to our needs in semi-automatic fashion. With the Samsung Galaxy S4, that realization draws ever closer, and it would do you well to experience it with this latest clever smartphone.\nHathem Brand has been writing about technology both professionally and freelance, dabbling in everything from laptops to e-recycling to future tech.

And those laws didn’t include ...","text":"Topics: Israel-Palestine , News , Politics News\n(Credit: AP)\nWeâ€™ve been hearing a lot lately about the 1 percent — the rich, the powerful, the ones who buy off our government, impose their wars, avoid paying their taxes, you know the ones.Â  The 99 percent — the rest of us â€“ are the ones who pay the price.\nBut there’s another Â 99/1 percent divide: over U.S. policy toward Israel and the whole world. Â Here the 1 percent are really on a roll. Â Right over the rest of us.\nThis struggle concerns the American people’s support for Â the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization known as UNESCO. The organization does a lot of important work, including identifying and protecting World Heritage Sites, working to broaden educational opportunities around the world and helping poor countries get access to scientific information.\nOne could certainly argue that for a self-interested American, UNESCO isnâ€™t crucial to U.S. national interests. One might say it does nothing more than make sure that tourist sites like the Cambodian temples of Angkor Wat or Australiaâ€™s Great Barrier Reef are still there when you want to see them.Â In fact, during the Cold War, Ronald Reagan pulled the U.S. out of UNESCO altogether; no one except maybe the historians, anthropologists, educators, cultural workers and a few insignificant others seemed to mind. It was almost a decade later that George Bush rejoined the organization.\nAnd here we are again. This time the U.S. Congress announced it is withholding this yearâ€™s UNESCO dues, within hours of the global organization welcoming a new member: Palestine.Â  In certain basic ways, UNESCO (like the United Nations itself) is like every little kidsâ€™ club: You donâ€™t pay your dues, youâ€™re out. In her press briefing just after the Paris vote, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the vote by the member states of UNESCO to admit Palestine as a member is “regrettable, premature and undermines our shared goal of accomplishing a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East. The United States remains steadfast in its support for the establishment of an independent and sovereign Palestinian state. But such a state can only be realized through direct negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians.â€�\nÂ Kicked out of the club\nApparently the U.S. made the judgment that stiffing the organization, risking the likelihood of being kicked out on its unilateralist behind, is a price worth paying â€“ to make the unsurprising political point that Washington is not happy about Palestinian statehood on any terms other than its own. Palestineâ€™s right to membership in this particular world body means UNESCO can make the determination that Palestine, rather than its occupying power Israel, has the right to nominate World Heritage Sites in its own territory, such as the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. It may not be the â€œindependent and sovereign Palestinian stateâ€� the U.S. claims it supports â€“ but it certainly helps achieve a few of Palestineâ€™s long-denied rights. And the 20 years of U.S.-controlled â€œpeace processâ€� has produced nothing for Palestinians except a tripling of illegal Israeli settlers on their land, certainly nothing remotely resembling a Palestinian state.\nThe decision to withhold the dues was in the interest of the foreign policy 1 percent — Israel and its most hard-line supporters in the U.S. â€“ not in the interest of the rest of us. In fact, there are potentially hazardous consequences ahead for a lot of us, including some of those who are most of the time part of the 1 percent.Â  Because achieving full membership in UNESCO is only the first step in the broader Palestinian plan at the U.N.\nOther organizations will follow, and one of the first is likely to be WIPO, the World Intellectual Property Organization. WIPO is hardly a household word but it is an important entity. WIPO figures out how to protect patents, royalty arrangements and trademarks, so not only cultural workers but the biggest high-tech industries have a huge investment there too. Thatâ€™s why the Obama administration convened a high-power meeting of corporate giants â€“ Google, Microsoft, Apple and others â€“ the day before the UNESCO vote, to see if they might have ideas to get out of the impasse.\nItâ€™s complicated, because this isnâ€™t just a political decision by the administration to cut the funding. Congress passed specific legislation, dating back to 1991 and 1994, requiring the U.S. government to do just that â€“ to withhold funds from any U.N. agency that recognizes Palestine on an equal basis with other states. And those laws didnâ€™t include the kind of presidential waiver Congress often adds when it knows it’s passing really stupid resolutions that are just for domestic political consumption. Like every year when members of Congress demand that the U.S. move its Israeli embassy to Jerusalem â€“ something no country in the world does â€“ they always include language that says â€œunless the President certifies that keeping the embassy in Tel Aviv is in the national security interest of the United States.â€�Â  Thatâ€™s the out.\nWho pays the price?\nThis time, thereâ€™s no obvious out. The problem is that if the United States has to leave WIPO, a lot of powerful corporations are going to be very unhappy. After WIPO, which U.N. agencies will be next to be defunded? Will it be the International Atomic Energy Agency, on whose reports U.S. strategists rely to figure out Iranâ€™s nuclear power program?Â  If an IAEA member state doesnâ€™t pay its dues, will it still have access to the agencyâ€™s classified reports? Will it be the World Health Organization, leaving the U.S. Centers for Disease Control outside of the global collaborations it depends on to fight the spread of devastating diseases?\nAnd thatâ€™s all just talking about what affects the U.S. and Americans directly.Â  What happens to children â€“ the worldâ€™s children, living across the impoverished global South â€“ when UNICEF loses 22 percent of its budget?Â  UNICEF is probably the most popular U.N. agency in the United States; will this yearâ€™s Halloween trick-or-treat Pennies for UNICEF campaign mark the last U.S. money to support the childrenâ€™s fund?\nThere has rarely been a clearer example of domestic politics â€“ in this case, influence of the pro-Israel lobbies â€“ undermining national interests.Â  Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of the most influential Republicans on foreign policy, said, “There’s a lot of bipartisan support for cutting off funding to any political U.N. organization that would do this. What you are going to do is eventually lose congressional support for our participation in the United Nations. That’s what’s at risk here. That would be a great loss.”Â  But while claiming to recognize U.S. interests in the U.N. agencies, Graham still plans to introduce a Senate resolution calling for withdrawal from UNESCO â€“ or any other U.N. agency recognizing Palestine on an equal basis.Â  Graham is known as the most pro-U.N. among Republicans (admittedly a low bar). Yet as the Cable reported, â€œ’When it comes to the issue of Palestinian recognition, the politics just don’t allow any room for compromise,’ he said.â€�\nÂ Bipartisan posturing\nOf course, there is no partisan divide when it comes to supporting Israelâ€™s insistence on no recognition for Palestine. The chairman of the Foreign Operations subcommittee, Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy, said he was fine with cutting off the funds. â€œThatâ€™s what the law requires. Itâ€™s been there for 20 years and whether I support it or not, thatâ€™s the law,â€� he said.\nAnd now thatâ€™s the challenge. Some in Washington may hope that Palestinian diplomats might offer a way out: agree not to apply for full membership in any more U.N. agencies in return for a settlement freeze and a return to some kind of negotiations.Â  But given the 20 years of failure of the U.S.-backed â€œpeace process,â€� and with the Arab Spring empowering Palestinian civil society, increasingly mobilized in favor of an entirely new approach, one based on international law and human rights, on nonviolent civil society mobilization instead of failed â€œbilateralâ€� negotiations, thatâ€™s not very likely.\nThe consequences of Washingtonâ€™s pro-Israel policies have rarely been so clear. The Obama administration is going to have to show some real leadership to get out of the impasse, to recognize that this is a different era than 20 years ago, and there is a different Middle East facing the U.S.Â  That means that claiming to support a Palestinian state, while undermining Washingtonâ€™s own support of and influence in vital U.N. agencies because they recognize Palestine as a state before we do, is not going to work.\nObama is going to have to recognize that itâ€™s no longer â€“ if it ever was â€“ political suicide to break with Israel, and announce that since we support Palestinian statehood thereâ€™s no reason why U.N. agencies shouldnâ€™t welcome Palestine as partners in protecting World Heritage Sites, or sorting out international copyrights, or helping to prevent global epidemics. If he has to challenge a couple of decades-old laws to do it, so be it.\nWe need the United Nations â€“ at least 99 percent of us do — a lot more than we need posturing about the alleged dangers of Palestine taking its seat in UNESCO. Itâ€™s time for the 1 percent to get out of the way.\nPhyllis Bennis is a Fellow of the Institute for Policy Studies.

Cook Ph.D.\nThank God Judge Goldstone recanted his judgment on Israel and its IDF forces in the slaughter inflicted on Gaza during its Christmas invasion in 2008-2009; both are now innocent of wrongful intent to kill Palestinian civilians since the Israeli military courts investigated Goldstone’s allegations and determined he was wrong. Now the good Judge has found, with the military court, that the Israeli government, that refused to cooperate with the United Nations investigation, did not intentionally send its forces to kill and destroy but only to kill and destroy Gaza; that the civilians were killed is simply a sad consequence of war. How astute, how learned, how compassionate; how absurd, how facetious, how despicable.\n \n \nYet, good may come of this decision. Now Israel is free to declare its innocence before the International Court of Justice since it is Israel’s investigation that can be presented as its case, with the good Judge as co-defendant. After all, isn’t this exactly what the Israeli government has wanted from the start, a way to demonstrate to the world that its Army is the most moral on the planet, its government the most democratic, acting only to defend its people, its weaponry the most sophisticated state of the art precision ordinance available, and its actions always proportionate to the crimes it seeks to address? Knowing now what they did not know before Judge Goldstone recanted his report, the government of Israel has nothing to fear from the ICJ but the justice it so rightfully deserves. Certainly it makes no sense for Israel or the UN to do nothing now that the report has been brought into question. The world has castigated Israel because of the report, now it’s Israel’s turn to seek revenge and put before the world how righteous and how legal its actions have been. How fortunate this turn of events.\nAnd how opportune a moment since our United States Congress has once again jumped to the fore as defender of the beleaguered state of Israel by writing a letter to the UNHRC that it should expunge the report from history since it is biased against the Jewish state and this would help make amends. (“Congressional initiatives targeting Goldstone report” April 11, 2011 JTA)But why expunge it? Israel, after all, knows it did no wrong; it has done its own investigation and declared its innocence. What an opportunity to show the world that it has been maligned, that it has obeyed all international laws relative to individual rights, that as an occupying force under Geneva Conventions and the Charter of the UN it has observed all requisite responsibilities toward the people of Gaza, and finally that it had rights to invade that the international community must recognize since it was only defending itself.\nLet us present this case as objectively as we can by using the words in the Israeli Gaza Operation Investigations: the means used to investigate, the difficulties that impeded the investigation, their presentation of the investigation concerning white phosphorus, and the conclusions drawn by the Military Advocate General, oh, and the convictions leveled on those found guilty. We’ll follow that presentation with some eye witness accounts of the Gaza operation, the affect of white phosphorus and its legality, and the impact of DIME explosives on humans and the environment. A few photos of Israeli use of white phosphorus will accompany this article if possible.  \nConsider the facts as articulated by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs as it labeled Cast Lead as Hamas war against Israel . [My apologies; I’m interjecting a subjective comment on Israel’s calling Operation Cast Lead “Hamas’ war against Israel.” In the 8 years preceding Cast Lead, Hamas or other resistance groups in Gaza, fired 6000 home made rockets at Israel, roughly 750 a year, or 62.5 per month or 2 per day. Twenty three people were killed. In that same period Israel killed more than 1000 Palestinian children and in Cast Lead killed an additional 352. A total of 1084 Israelis were killed between 2000 and 2008, but 6430 Palestinians were killed. Yet it was Hamas’ war against Israel. One final observation: Israel’s launch of one of its American supplied missiles that cost $300,000, a fraction of the 8.2 million per day we supply to Israel’s military, a precision state of the art weapon that hit a home where the IDF ordered people to go, in less than one minute killed 21 members of the Samouni family, nine of them children.] (figures from ifamericansknew.org and see this author’s article “Consider the Realities of Gaza,” Counterpunch, Jan. 5, 2009). Back to our sources and let the reader be judge.\n \n Gaza Operation Investigations: An Update Jan 2010.\n1. Israel\u0027s investigative system has multiple layers of review to ensure impartiality and independence. These include the Military Advocate General\u0027s Corps (MAG), which determines whether to initiate criminal investigations and file charges against IDF soldiers. The Military Advocate General is legally independent from the military chain of command. Israel\u0027s Attorney General provides civilian oversight, as any decision of the Military Advocate General on whether or not to investigate or indict may be subject to his review.\n2. The Operation in Gaza: Factual and Legal Aspects , which addressed a range of factual and legal issues related to the Gaza Operation. The Operation in Gaza also set out the legal framework governing the use of force and the principles - including the principles of distinction and proportionality - that apply in such a conflict. It also described the IDF\u0027s efforts to ensure compliance with these principles during the Gaza Operation and the modus operandi of Hamas, in particular its abuses of civilian protections that created such acute operational dilemmas.\n3. Describing the application of these mechanisms to the Gaza Operation, the Paper notes that the IDF to date has launched investigations of 150 separate incidents arising from the Gaza Operation. A number of these were opened at the IDF\u0027s own initiative. Others were opened in response to complaints and reports from Palestinian civilians, local and international non-governmental organisations, and U.N. and media reports.\nConclusions:\n183. The Gaza Operation presented complex challenges to Israel and the IDF. While the need and obligation to respond effectively to the thousands of Hamas rockets and mortars that had terrorized Israeli civilians for years was clear and acute, the strategies adopted by Hamas, and in particular its systematic entrenchment in the heart of civilian areas, created profound operational dilemmas. [A second interruption if I may: consider the reality of the Palestinians’ plight; they can go nowhere, they cannot escape through the Israeli gates, they can not flee by car, rail, air, boat or on foot, and they are caged in a steel enclosed land area blocked on the west by Israeli gunboats. They have no army, no air force, no navy; but they were training police to help provide order inside this cage of chaos, and Israel began its operation by killing 50 of the graduating class on December 27, 2008.]\n184. These challenges did not end with the close of operations. A key element of respecting the Law of Armed Conflict is a commitment genuinely to review military operations after the fact, and thoroughly investigate allegations of unlawful activity. Fulfilling this commitment in the context of Gaza is demanding, and requires serious efforts to obtain evidence from battleground situations and to make arrangements to enable residents of Gaza to give their accounts. It also requires an awareness that, in complex combat situations, errors of judgment, even with tragic results, do not necessarily mean that violations of the Law of Armed Conflict have occurred. [Note that Israel refused to cooperate with the UNHRC investigation that became the Goldstone Report.]\n187. Israel recognizes the importance of engaging in dialogue and sharing best practices on theconduct of investigative proceedings with other democratic states facingsimilar challenges and committed to upholding the rule of law.\nObviously this article cannot provide a complete rendering of the Israeli investigation and its conclusions regarding proper conduct under international law. However, one of the more telling concerns raised about the IDF was its use of white phosphorus. Here is the comment from the Israeli operation cast lead investigation on that subject. Section IV contains others.\nIV. COMPLAINTS ALLEGING VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW\nOF ARMED CONFLICT DURING THE GAZA OPERATION\n89. Israel is aware of concerns raised regarding the Gaza Operation. As discussed in detail in The Operation in Gaza, and as outlined above, the deliberate strategy of Hamas to blend in with the civilian population made it difficult for the IDF to achieve the objective of the Gaza Operation – reducing the threat of deliberate attacks against Israeli civilians – while also avoiding harm to Palestinian civilians. To be sure, the IDF undertook strenuous efforts to minimise such harm. It intensively trained its personnel on the requirements of the Law of Armed Conflict. It delayed, diverted, or refrained from attacks to spare civilian life. It provided numerous and varied types of concrete warnings before launching attacks.\n88 Nevertheless, Israel’s efforts to comply with the Law of Armed Conflict do not lessen its regret for the loss of innocent lives and damage to civilian property.\n93. The unique difficulties involved in the investigation of alleged violations of the Law of Armed Conflict in the battlefield should not be ignored. They include: the inability to\nsecure the scene for forensic and physical evidence, either during a battle or after, when\nthe territory is under enemy control; the possible destruction of evidence during fighting\nand the possible manipulation of the scene by the enemy; the need to recall reserve\nsoldiers back for questioning; the difficulty of accurately identifying the location of an\nincident, when it is described in local and unofficial terms and slang; and the need to\nlocate the adversary’s civilians as witnesses and overcome their natural suspicion and fear of reprisals by their authorities.90\n(v) The use of weaponry containing phosphorous\n117. This investigation dealt with the use of weapons containing phosphorous by IDF forces during the Gaza Operation. The investigation focused on the different types and number of weapons containing phosphorous used during the Operation, the purposes for which they were used, the applicable professional instructions and rules of engagement, and the extent of compliance with those instructions and rules. Some of the findings of the special command investigation are detailed in The Operation in Gaza.107\n118. The Military Advocate General reviewed the entire record of the special command\ninvestigation. With respect to exploding munitions containing white phosphorous, the\nMilitary Advocate General concluded that the use of this weapon in the operation was consistent with Israel’s obligations under international law.\n119. With respect to smoke projectiles, the Military Advocate General found that international law does not prohibit use of smoke projectiles containing phosphorous. Specifically, such projectiles are not “incendiary weapons,” within the meaning of the Protocol on 106 Id. ¶¶ 436-45. Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Incendiary Weapons,108 because they are not primarily designed to set fire or to burn. The Military Advocate General further determined that during the Gaza Operation, the IDF used such smoke projectiles for military purposes only, for instance to camouflage IDF armor forces from Hamas’s antitank units by creating smoke screens.\n120. The Military Advocate General found no grounds to take disciplinary or other measures for the IDF’s use of weapons containing phosphorous, which involved no violation of the Law of Armed Conflict. Nevertheless, the Military Advocate General’s opinion did not address a number of specific complaints that were received after the investigation concluded and which are being investigated separately.(vi)\nBased on information from B’Tselem and Euromedrights.org, the determinations by the Israeli investigation resulted in the following charges: “In the over two years since Operation Cast Lead, Israel and the Palestinian side have failed to conduct genuine investigations, and where appropriate, prosecutions. To-date one Israeli soldier has served 7.5 months in jail for the theft of a credit card and two others have received three month suspended sentences for using a Palestinian child as a human shield. These three convictions, and the ongoing trial of a fourth soldier, have been the only concrete judicial outcomes of Israeli Operation Cast Lead investigations. It is noted that neither these indictments nor the sentences handed down for the human shield conviction reflect the gravity of the actual crimes committed. It appears that the majority of other investigative procedures have been closed without charge. All alleged international crimes must be subject to genuine investigation, and, if appropriate, those responsible must be prosecuted in accordance with the requirements of international law. In light of the domestic authorities’ failure to conduct such investigation, the International Criminal Court now constitutes the most appropriate forum, as recommended by the Human Rights Council on 25 March.(Euromedrights.org)\nTo date, no independent investigation apparatus, empowered also to investigate the responsibility of the political and military decision-makers, has been established. According to the report that the Foreign Ministry provided to the UN in July 2010, the Judge Advocate General’s office ordered 47 Military Police investigations with respect to Operation Cast Lead. B\u0027Tselem is aware of 20 Military Police investigations of incidents in which a suspicion arose that soldiers in the field violated army regulations. Four soldiers have been prosecuted for three incidents that occurred during the operation. In the first case, a soldier was convicted of stealing a credit card and sentenced to seven and a half months\u0027 imprisonment, a conditional sentence of seven and a half months, and demotion from sergeant to private. In the second case, indictments were filed against two soldiers alleging they used a nine-year-old child as a human shield, ordering him to open suspected booby-trapped bags. The two soldiers were convicted and sentenced to a three-month suspended jail sentence and demotion in rank from staff sergeant to private. In the third case, an indictment was filed against a soldier for killing an anonymous person and conduct unbecoming a soldier. In three other cases, disciplinary proceedings were instituted against six officers. B\u0027Tselem is aware of at least six cases in which the Attorney General decided not to indict the soldiers. (B’Tselem).\nNow let us return to the arguments for a UN investigation that can provide the people of the world with deliberations that place the Israeli Operation Cast Lead before an International Court of Justice.\nPhosphorous Bomb Rain Over Northern Gaza\nHiyam Noir , in Palestine Free Voice, January 13, 2009, reporting from Gaza observed\n“Blankets of white clouds covered the skies over Gaza, including the refuge camps in Khan Younis, Beit Lahia and Gaza City.  On Saturday Israeli F16 warplanes launched attacks using phosphorus bombs on the Block 2 section inside the densely populated Jabalya Refuge Camp. Many residents of Jabalya escaped the area covering their faces, searching for a safe shelter in the home of relatives and friends in the neighboring Beit Lahia from the Israelis \"Cast Lead Operation\". Gaza has always been the Israelis “testing ground” – from nerve agents used in Khan Younis in 2003, to Sonic Boom “phantom air raids”, and the use of DIME in the Israelis massacre called \" Operation Summer Rain \" over Gaza year 2006.”\nIn that same article, Noir notes, The Human Rights Watch senior analyst Marc Garlasco said in an interview on France Chanel 4 TV that ..\"Israeli artillery bursted fire of white phosphorous shells over Gaza City.\"Garlasco said ..\"I have been standing at the border for the last few days ,watching Israeli artillery firing white phosphorus shells into refugee camps\".\nPress TV on 4 March 2011 reported that cancer cases in Gaza had increased by 30 per cent, and that there was a link between the occurrence of the disease and residence in areas that had been badly hit by Israeli bombing. Zekra Ajour from the Al-Dameer Association for Human Rights told the channel that Gaza had been a testing ground for illegal weapons.\nIn a separate article, Richard Lightbown argues that Israel’s use of white phosphorus and other toxic metals, and its suspected use of depleted uranium, in the war against the people of the Gaza Strip has put the whole of the Strip’s population and its environment – air, soil, groundwater and possibly seawater – at risk of serious long-term injury and contamination. He also observes that The goldstone report mentions phosphorus in paragraph 896: Medical staff reported to the mission how even working in the areas where the phosphorus had been used made them feel sick, their lips would swell and they would become extremely thirsty and nauseous.\nThe toxicity of phosphorus is also recorded in a report by New York medical staff: 4\n‘Oral ingestion of white phosphorus in humans has been demonstrated to result in pathologic changes to the liver and kidneys. The ingestion of a small quantity of white phosphorus can cause gastrointestinal complaints such as nausea, abdominal cramps, and vomiting. Individuals with a history of oral ingestion have been noted to pass phosphorus-laden stool (\"smoking stool syndrome\"). The accepted lethal dose is 1 mg/kg, although the ingestion of as little as 15 mg has resulted in death.’\nAlthough an Israeli army spokesman told CNN on 7 January 2009, “I can tell you with certainty that white phosphorus is absolutely not being used.” the chemical had been used by Israeli forces since the beginning of the war. 12 The Goldstone Report stated that Israeli sources later claimed their forces had stopped using white phosphorous on 7 January 2009 because of international concerns. This was also untrue as there is evidence that it had been used after that date. Goldstone declared the Israeli armed forces to have been “systematically reckless” in using white phosphorous in built-up areas (paragraphs 884, 886 and 890).\nLightbown also discusses DIME: “Evidence of the use of   depleted uranium against Gaza is tenuous and Goldstone merely recorded in   paragraph 907 that it had received allegations which it had not further   investigated. Much of this evidence came from Action   des citoyens pour le désarmement nucléaire (ACDN: Citizens   Action for Nuclear Disarmament). Their report of July 2009 hypothesizes that the   GBU-39 bunker-buster bomb is packed with 75 kilogram of depleted uranium. (A   UNEP report also ambiguously refers to bunker-buster bombs containing   depleted uranium.) The US delivery of 1,000 of these bombs to Israel arrived   in early December 2008 shortly before the start of the war. The GBU-39 is   considered one of the world’s most precise bombs and Boeing, the   manufacturer, claims that the bomb will penetrate three feet of   steel-reinforced concrete. (UNEP suggests that it can penetrate reinforced   concrete to depths ranging from 1.8 to over 6 metres.) Boeing’s patent on the   weapon mentions depleted uranium. 6\nIt is not known how many bunker-buster bombs were used against Gaza but it   seems reasonable to assume that the number could run into hundreds. It is   thought that they were used mostly in the Philadelphia corridor against the   tunnels. Desmond Travers, the former Irish army officer who was a member of   the Goldstone Commission, would only say that depleted uranium may have been used during the war, although he did agree that it would have been   well suited for attacking the tunnels where maximum penetration would have   been desired. 7 He was also in   agreement with ACDN that the use of below-ground targets would have   considerably reduced the levels of aerosol uranium that was dispersed into   the air.\nIn April 2009 Jean-François Fechino from ACDN was part of a four-person team   which went to Gaza for the Arab Commission for Human Rights .   Samples that the team brought back were analysed by a specialist laboratory   which identified carcinogens: depleted uranium, caesium, asbestos dust,   tungsten and aluminium oxide. Thorium oxide was also found, which is   radioactive, as are depleted uranium and caesium. The analysis also   identified phosphates and copper, along with volatile organic compounds   (VOCs) which are a health hazard, especially to children, asthmatics and   elders. 9\nDepleted uranium burns at almost 1200 degrees Celsius. (TNT by comparison   burns at 576 degrees Celsius.) 10 At this temperature   the fire vaporizes any metals in the target which in combination with uranium   are released into the air in aerosol form. After deposition the aerosols have   the potential to contaminate groundwater. (The Gaza aquifer, which is the   Strip’s only water source, is also connected to ground water supplies in   Egypt, although water only flows into Gaza from Israel. 11 )\nThe Goldstone Commission was unable to confirm that DIME munitions were used   by Israeli forces during Operation Cast Lead. Col Lane had told the   commission in testimony that there was no actual proof. He then went on to   testify that he had been given samples in Gaza which analysis in Dublin had   shown to contain DIME materials consisting mostly of tungsten with traces of   iron and sulphur. He was of the opinion that ordnance had been used that had   some sort of DIME component. He also mentioned that he had read of unusual   amputations, and that tungsten and cobalt would have this effect. Weaponry   had been found with DIME components which was capable of amputation and there   are Palestinian amputees, yet neither Col Lane nor the commission was   prepared to say that DIME weapons had been used by Israeli forces.\nDIME bombs cause a high proportion of amputations particularly of legs, while   patients often suffered internal burns as well. The bombs consist of powdered   tungsten alloy mixed with an explosive material inside a casing which   disintegrates on explosion. The tungsten powder tears apart anything it hits   including soft tissue and bone, causing very severe injuries. Tungsten alloy   particles, described as “finely powdered micro-shrapnel\", are too small   to be extracted from the victim’s body and are highly carcinogenic.   (Goldstone, paragraphs 902-4)\nThe whole Gaza population and their environment, including generations yet to   be conceived, have been put at risk of serious long-term injury from heavy   metal pollution of the air, soil and groundwater (and possibly the seawater   too), while the causal pollution is likely to cross state borders into Egypt   and even into Israel. Reassurances of the legitimate and responsible use and   the reduced lethality of weapons (an opinion in part shared by Col Lane) are   callous and inadequate in the context of the dangerous reality that has   resulted. Meanwhile, the impacts of Israel’s illegal assaults on Gaza remain   ignored and its deeds uncensored by the wider international community.”\nCertainly it makes good sense to have the Israeli   investigation brought before the ICJ. What possible reason exists not to do   this, from either the Israeli perspective or the UNHRC. The perspectives   presented above demonstrate the necessity; truth requires it, justice demands   it, and the dead cry out for it.\nNOTE: The footnotes below are from Lightbown’s article   which can be accessed at www.redress.cc/palestine/lightbown200110314 .

About cancer.\nThe film (originally titled with the slightly more jarring \" I\u0027m With Cancer \") is inspired by the true-life story of screenwriter Will Reiser\u0027s battle with cancer.\n\"We worked with Will on Da Ali G show, and it was shortly after that we learned he was sick,\" Rogen, a real-life friend of Reiser, says on the film\u0027s website . \"As shocking, sad, confusing and generally screwed up as it was, we couldn\u0027t ignore that because we were so ill-equipped to deal with the situation, funny things kept happening.\"\nAnd funny it is. After Adam receives his (comically hard to pronounce) diagnosis of a malignant, fast growing back tumor, Rogen\u0027s character Kyle comforts his friend by reminding him of stars who have beat cancer (Seth Green, Lance Armstrong and ... Patrick Swayze -- scratch that) and making an argument that if he were a Las Vegas game, his heads-or-tails odds would be the best in the house. We see the bleak reality of Adam\u0027s cancer ward through the colorful lens of medical-marijuana-laced macaroons and watch as the two friends play the \"cancer card\" to pick up girls.\nIn a movie genre where the Kleenex are typically more plentiful than the belly laughs, \"50/50\" is anything but expected or melodramatic -- yet it poses the question of whether it\u0027s okay to find humor in life\u0027s tragedies, especially those we firmly understand are no laughing matter.\n\"Having a comedic approach to cancer makes the experience feasible,\" Hollye Harrington Jacobs, who was diagnosed with breast cancer last year at the age of 39, told The Huffington Post. \"Finding humor is absolutely, positively, 100 percent therapeutic.\"\nJacobs, also a HuffPost blogger , says she encouraged humor throughout her treatment process, which has included a double mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiation. \"Often, I found that my life was comedy of the absurd in that one thing after the other happened,\" she says. \"And I kept laughing.\"\nTurns out, that approach can be a healthy one.\n\"[Humor] is sort of social lubricant and a relief of tension and a way of coping,\" Richard Penson, M.D., assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and clinical director of Medical Gynecologic Oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital, told The Huffington Post. \"It\u0027s not just the funny people who use humor in oncology. Better practitioners often use humor as a very sophisticated support.\"\nIn fact, a recent study out of Northwestern University found that doctors across a variety of practices may find that using a bit of light humor can help to relieve anxiety and keep the focus on recovery.\nPenson cautions that humor is high-risk -- it could offend someone who is going through a tough time. But anecdotal evidence, as seen in both Reiser\u0027s real-life experience and his film adaptation, suggests teens and young adults may be the most open to incorporating humor of the type he describes as \"gallows humor\" or \"so awful it\u0027s funny.\"\nIn a 2009 Newsweek piece , following the release of the cancer dramedy predecessor, \"Funny People,\" writer Iva Skoch explored that idea of gallows humor. Skoch was a young, athletic nonsmoker who was diagnosed with colon cancer. After an ironically humorous run-in with a woman on the subway (read the anecdote here ), Skoch wrote:\nCancer. Hilarious. I later typed these words into Google and found Kaylin Andres, a 24-year-old San Francisco fashion designer who was diagnosed with Ewing\u0027s sarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer normally found in children, last September. She uses her blog, Cancer Is Hilarious , to document her experience in a way young people could relate. Thank God for cancer humor. I need something other than yet another study that offered grim survival rates or scary-sounding side effects.\nAccording to the National Cancer Institute, more than 72,000 young adults between the ages of 15 and 39 are diagnosed each year. As Skoch reports in her article, today\u0027s cancer systems are often set up for older patients, meaning young adults like Adam can feel simultaneously too old for pediatric care and too young for the infrastructure in place for the over-50 set.\nSites like Planet Cancer (founded by young cancer survivors) and I\u0027m Too Young For This (with the tagline \"Stupid Cancer\") offer a combination of resources, jokes and black-humor merchandise.\n\"So, welcome to the club that no one wants to belong to but once you\u0027re here, you\u0027re family. Just like The Olive Garden, except pretty much the exact opposite,\" reads the I\u0027m Too Young For This homepage. \"It\u0027s life + cancer, where remission is not a cure and survivorship is all that matters.\"\nRegardless of age, humor may have real healing powers aside from helping in the coping process. The American Cancer Society recognizes humor therapy (also known as laugh therapy) as a complementary and alternative treatment for cancer. While they point out that there\u0027s no scientific evidence that laughter can cure cancer or any disease, it can help to \"improve quality of life, provide pain relief, encourage relaxation and reduce stress,\" and maybe even stimulate the circulatory and immune systems (along with other systems in the body).\nWhile \"50/50\" is definitely laugh-out-loud funny, it\u0027s also cry-out-loud sad -- and in that way, it becomes even more poignant than other cancer-genre films that focus only on the dramatic. The humor ultimately makes the heartbreaking moments resonate even more, painting a realistic, holistic picture of Adam\u0027s path of healing. Real life can be painfully sad -- and sometimes, it can be really, really funny along the way.\n\"50/50\" is out nationally this weekend -- check out the trailer and exclusive interviews with the cast from Moviefone below.\nLooking for another poignant movie relating to cancer?

He puts \"the conflicts in Palestine, Chechnya and Kashmir\" in the latter category: \"No one can deny the horror of Palestinian and Chechen attacks upon civilians ...","text":"Print\nFor most observers, Leon Wieseltier\u0027s latest attack on me as an anti-Semite, without even the candor to say so (since that would contradict his previous categorical refutation of the idea), may seem somewhat over the top. And, as many have already noted, there is a long history here, which it is unseemly to disinter and tedious to recount.\nBut I do want to note that it is a history of deep love and friendship and mentorship, for which I shall always be deeply grateful, as well as of eventually profound animosity. The day I sero-converted to HIV, a fact I couldn\u0027t tell anyone (even my mother who was hospitalized with severe depression at the time), he took me into his home and cared for me like a brother. He is a man capable of immense kindness, of brilliant humor, and is probably the funniest single person I have ever come across. I also deeply respect his quite remarkable legacy as editor of the literary section of the New Republic which I was honored to edit for a while under his guidance. In the good old days, I took him to gay bars (he has not a shred of homophobia); as a Jew and a Catholic, we read Buddhist scriptures together. We were, in fact, somewhat painfully alike in many ways: religious traditionalists whose reverence for our faiths was also marked by our rebellion within them. We share a commitment to secularism and religion, these days a very rare combination. His mentor was Isaiah Berlin; mine Michael Oakeshott. Their differences are fascinating but minor - and they too, sadly, came to despise each other.\nAlthough the collapse of our friendship was among the most hurtful of my life, and for which I take my own share of responsibility, I remain an admirer of his intellect. I have tried to move on, and although I have occasionally thrown a tease about his sometimes impenetrable prose, or got him to make a factual correction, I also posted this quite recently of a review he wrote for the NYTBR:\nThis is a very pithy summary of a view of politics and religion that I share and that Leon helped me appreciate and understand. The quote is an hors d\u0027oeuvre before the main course, however, which is this essay: clear, stringent, restrained where necessary, vicious when warranted ... and, well, humane. It\u0027s an important essay because within it, there pulsates a whole slew of vital issues where some level of contradiction and tension is far more defensible than their opposites: being a Jew and an American, being a conservative who can see the role of liberalism in the West (and vice-versa), and being a secular citizen with profound respect for and engagement with religious truth.\nI think it\u0027s the best thing Wieseltier has written in memory - and reminds me of what an immense and powerful talent he remains.\nPeople have referred to this contretemps as the continuation of a tit for tat. More tit than tat, I\u0027d say. But his newest charge deserves treatment beyond this personal history, because it is a very grave one.\nHis accusation of anti-Semitism is wounding because from my teenage years, the Holocaust has remained in my mind and soul as a defining event in human history, and, as a Catholic, I have struggled mightily to hold my own faith fully accountable for its historical contribution to it. I have also an extremely long record of calling out genuine anti-Semitism on this blog - not as a way to score points against my critics, or to police the domestic discourse - but because I think it is an eternal toxin for which my own Church bears a huge amount of responsibility and which needs to be confronted wherever it appears. I despise the Iranian regime in part for its murderous and disgusting anti-Semitism, as I do Hamas and Hezbollah. Maybe other non-Jewish writers have a stronger or deeper record of this than I, but I did my best. It is demeaning to point to the many instances, as if I were in a dock and presumed guilty before having to prove myself innocent. But the record is plainly there (just search this blog or google it); it is voluminous; it is deep; and it is quite patently sincere.\nThere is also some irony here since my political position on Israel remains, so far as I can tell, extremely close to Leon\u0027s. I favor a two-state solution along the 1967 lines (give or take a few adjustments to reality on the ground), a partition of Jerusalem, and guarantees for both Israel\u0027s security and that of the Palestinians, whose suffering and constant humiliation is indisputable. I cannot see a full right of return being viable, and I would like to save the idea of a specifically Jewish state from demographic suicide, and because I see the Jewish faith as the foundation of my own and my Jewish friends as more than just my friends, but part of a spiritual brotherhood.\nEven on the Gaza war, which was, for me, a turning point in my view of the Israel that is emerging with ever more danger to itself and the entire world, Leon and I have very similar positions, so far as I can tell. He has a long record of calling out the racist religious right in Israel, although much less so now than in the past. Again, I posted on this blog his very elegant description of the situation a year ago:\n\"I have a sickened feeling about the recent campaign in Gaza. No sovereign state can accept regular aggressions across its border, but Operation Cast Lead seems to have accomplished nothing. Hamas is again firing its rockets, Israel is again retaliating against them, and Israeli politicians are again making virile promises to finish the job. The suffering of the people of Gaza during the war was partly the responsibility of their own astoundingly callous leaders, but not entirely. Israel\u0027s choice of tactics and strategies was its own; and when it chose blunt instruments, it guaranteed harsh consequences.\"\nNow Leon used those words weeks after the onslaught, and I am a blogger writing in real time, reacting to the horrifying scenes of suffering, of the heads of children buried in rubble. Whatever the context, watching largely defenseless, densely packed urban areas being pummeled with missiles is traumatizing. I don\u0027t see how a human being can watch it and not feel for those innocents trapped in terror below. I have Irish blood and a Catholic conscience. Seeing this happen in real time was as vivid for me as it was watching the people of Iran last June. There will be times in which the emotion of the moment overwhelms me. Leon despises blogging, but I see its merits as long as it is seen in proper context as provisional truth, not considered analysis. Read my Sunday Times columns or Atlantic essays to see the difference. So maybe my reaction was over-wrought. But it was certainly not over-wrought because of some kind of anti-Semitism. To be honest, I was also shocked. This was not the Israel I thought I knew.\nTo address the substantive points:\nAs evidence of my anti-Semitism, Wieseltier first cites a post in which I distinguish between \"Most American Jews [who] retain a respect for learning, compassion for the other, and support for minorities (Jews, for example, are the ethnic group most sympathetic to gay rights)\" and those who celebrated the Gaza attack and defend the torture of terror suspects. (I must say I\u0027m relieved that even Leon cannot defend Michael Goldfarb!) This, apparently, to Leon, is dividing Jews between \"good\" and \"bad\" which, I am informed, has a \"sordid history.\"\nI\u0027m sorry if Leon immediately saw my distinction between some neocons and many non-neocons as some kind of reference to ancient persecution. But what am I to do if I am trying to describe my support for J-Street over AIPAC on these matters, or for the younger generation of American-Jewish writers as opposed to their elders? Is this analysis something no non-Jew is allowed to even discuss, for fear of offending? How am I able as a writer to make occasional distinctions between American Jewish factions whose views I have come to support and those I don\u0027t? To give a counter-example, in my writing about homosexuals for the past twenty years, I have often distinguished between the gay left and the gay right, between strategies and arguments I support and those I oppose. Are we supposed to think that this is some kind of dark reference to the ways in which totalitarian countries persecute openly gay or effeminate gays and leave the closeted macho types alone? Please. This is searching for animus that simply isn\u0027t there.\nIn defense of Charles Krauthammer\u0027s support for torture - yes Leon Wieseltier is defending Charles Krauthammer, as Washington freezes over - Leon writes:\nKrauthammer argues for his views; the premises of his analysis are coldly clear, and may be engaged analytically, and when necessary refuted. Unlike Sullivan, he does not present feelings as ideas.\nActually, I responded to Krauthammer\u0027s first, formative and reasoned essay not with mere \"feelings as ideas\" but with careful and respectful arguments. And the essay, \" The Abolition Of Torture \", appeared in The New Republic! Leon appears not to have read it. All I ask is that someone read that essay and see if they think that my case is a hunt \"for motives, not reasons; for conspiracies, which is the surest sign of a mind’s bankruptcy.\" It is an impassioned case for the American idea. My blogging on this subject has also been packed with fact, argument, research, logic and debate. To give one example, this pivotal post about the Nazi origins of \"enhanced interrogations.\"\nThen we come to the question of \"The Israel Lobby\". Leon argues that I am of \"the party of Mearesheimer and the clique of Walt\". He has long since demonized them as the modern equivalent of der Sturmer. I have, in fact, criticized the book in some respects. Shortly after it was published, I wrote :\nI haven\u0027t written much about the Walt-Mearesheimer book because it\u0027s long and I haven\u0027t had time to read it. (There\u0027s a concept: a blogger not posting about something he knows nothing about.) But it is interesting, it seems to me, that the debate about the Middle East does indeed feel freer in Israel than in the US, where some American Jews have a defensiveness and anger that makes calm debate very difficult. (I guess I should add that my impression of the Walt-Mearesheimer book - I did read the original article - is that it\u0027s shoddy enough to merit Jewish defensiveness and anger. Sigh.)\nBut I do respect professors John Mearesheimer and Stephen Walt. I am not going to be a party to their demonization and attempted ostracism because they dared open a necessary discussion that so many tried to shut down before it even began. At TNR, I ran a cover-story by Mearesheimer, a realist case for the partition of Bosnia. I studied Walt\u0027s work in the Government Department at Harvard and I don\u0027t recall it being outrageous, even if it was a little dull for my taste.\nMy own views on foreign policy have shifted back and forth over the years - which does not make me a \"Buchanan of the left\", as Leon ludicrously claims. It makes me a conservative of the kind I tried to explain in my most recent book , and is perhaps best explained in this post . I think one should adjust to events and times, even though deep down, my own preference is a kind of warm-hearted realism. I did have a neocon phase, especially after 9/11, when neoconservatism\u0027s analysis of the world seemed to me in my anger and fear the most coherent on offer. But as I have surveyed the catastrophes and countless deaths visited upon the world by neoconservatism since, and wrestled with my own misjudgments and errors, I have come to appreciate more deeply the wisdom of foreign policy realists (and look back more fondly on Reagan\u0027s later years and the first president Bush).\nMost of the neocons, with some exceptions, such as Frank Fukuyama, seem incapable of self-reflection, of conceding error, of feeling any moral responsibility for the horrors they have inflicted - perhaps with the best of intentions - on the world. Although there can be a heartlessness in the soul of realism which I find personally hard to embrace, it sure has the recent evidence on its side.\nThen this assertion that I subscribe to some dark conspiracy theory that \"the Jews control Washington.\" I\u0027m sorry but this really is a vile lie, a stark accusation of anti-Semitism, unsupported by any evidence. The only people I have ever heard refer continuously and emphatically to \"the Jews\" as a single global entity wrote for The New Republic. This was often humorous and self-mocking, of course, until it wasn\u0027t. But I might as well state clearly what I do believe - and know almost no-one in Washington who isn\u0027t a fanatic who doesn\u0027t - that AIPAC\u0027s perfectly legal, perfectly open, brilliantly conducted lobbying operation has massive influence in the Congress. Really, any dissenters?\nI have also noted that many, many other powerful lobbies exist. At TNR, I ran a major story on the malign influence of the Cuban lobby, for example, which exerted disproportionate power and distorted US foreign policy in ways that I came to believe hurt Cubans and Americans. I don\u0027t remember being accused of being bigoted about Cubans for it. But somehow criticizing AIPAC is something forbidden for non-Jews - for fear of being labeled an anti-Semite or, if you are Jewish, a \"self-hating Jew\". I refuse to be cowed by such bullying tactics. And thanks to the fact that the blogosphere now exists, such bullying is far less effective than it once was in the past.\nWieseltier then makes some wild whiffs that \"[Sullivan] prefers not to dive deep into the substance of anything.\" Let\u0027s take just one example he cites:\n\"Does he believe that the Israeli war against Hamas was an unjust war, or that Israel should have continued to absorb Hamas’s rocket attackswhich were indisputably criminaland not acted with force against them? His answers may be inferred from his various ejaculations“the pulverization of Gazans,” for example, is a phrase that is calculatedly indifferent to the wrenching moral and strategic perplexities that are contained in the awful reality of asymmetrical warfarebut they are not so much answers as bar-room retorts; moody explosions of verbal violence; more invective from another American crank.\"\nWell let us look at the actual record (thank God for Google). This blog conducted one of its longer threads on the questions of just war and proportionality during and after the Gaza onslaught. I urge fair-minded readers to read them sequentially and see if all I did was utter \"bar-room retorts\" or \"moody explosions of verbal violence.\" The thread starts here and includes all angles and runs to thousands and thousands of words. From the beginning, the posts are here , here , here , here , here , here ,  and here . I may have missed some, but you browse the archives in January 2009 and see just how deep, various and open the debate was. On this, as on so much else, Wieseltier accuses someone of something he hasn\u0027t bothered to do even the faintest due diligence on. He should try getting an editor.\nLeon then drags out some of my more hysterical and emotional posts during and immediately after the 9/11 attack. He does not refer to my considered takes on what it all meant in the NYT Magazine here or my essay, \" This Is A Religious War .\" Yes, I confess and have often apologized for the excess of some of my rhetoric at the time. It was a traumatizing time and I was horrified and my emotions got the better of me at times. I wasn\u0027t the only one, of course, in a country still polarized by the 2000 recount, but it\u0027s still no excuse. He even brings up my infamous sentence in a 6,000 word piece in the days after 9/11 about a \"a fifth column\" among some far leftists. He omits to note that I regretted that phrase - and its misleading implications - days thereafter, and pledged never to use it or anything like it again. More recently, I wrote\nIn the emotional days after the destruction of the World Trade Center, there was at least as much heat as light. I myself wrote a sloppy throwaway sentence effectively accusing such \"enclaves\" on the far left of being a virtual and potential \"fifth column\" in the coming war. I regret that ugly coinage and said so days later.\nThis is odd because these sentences appeared in a review I wrote for the New Republic\u0027s literary section, edited by Leon Wieseltier. And what on earth has this to do with my alleged anti-Semitism? Seriously, is he this intent on throwing everything but the kitchen sink at me?\nAs for Hamas, I have never, ever done anything but condemn their vile anti-Semitism. As for their rocket attacks against Israeli citizens, I have consistently referred to them as war crimes. My Face of the Day on May 16, 2007 , was of a young Ethiopian Jewish immigrant boy shedding a tear as he took refuge in a bomb shelter in Sderot, Israel. I reported that \"at least 30 Israelis have been injured from more than 25 Qassam rockets that have fallen in the area in the past 24 hours.\"\nThen there are his semantics over fundamentalism. My point is an obvious one: many of the West Bank settlers, especially the more extreme ones, are religious fanatics. There is no political settlement to be had with those who base their views on divine sanction. Then Wieseltier asks the following unhinged question:\nAnd does Sullivan have any notion of the magnitude and the virulence of Muslim contempt for the Jewish world? Muslim contempt for Jews does not justify Jewish contempt for Muslims, of course; but nothing justifies Sullivan’s refusal to give the whole picture.\nHow can anyone who has ever read anything of mine over the last few years not know of my insistent, repeated, analysis and condemnation of Muslim anti-Semitism. I have \"refused\" to give the whole picture? This is an unforgivable lie that requires a factual retraction and apology from TNR. My exposure of Islamism from 9/11 on has been relentless. But let me give a simple, lone example in a review I wrote for TNR, again edited by Wieseltier, in which I criticized the book because\nThere is no mention in the book of the pathological anti-Semitism that currently accompanies these traditional Islamic societies. But D\u0027Souza goes out of his way to draw a distinction between Islamist terrorism undertaken purely in the name of jihad -- September 11, the Bali bombing, the London and Madrid massacres -- and terrorism that he regards as legitimate self-defense. He puts \"the conflicts in Palestine, Chechnya and Kashmir\" in the latter category: \"No one can deny the horror of Palestinian and Chechen attacks upon civilians, but these have to be measured against the state-sponsored terror on the other side: the bulldozing of Palestinian homes, the shooting of stone-throwing teenagers, the obliteration of the Chechen capital of Grozny...by Russian troops.\"\nAgain I wrote this for Wieseltier. And yet he asserts that \"nothing justifies Sullivan’s refusal to give the whole picture.\" Refusal implies I knew better and decided to withhold the evidence to single out Jewish prejudice. This is truly unforgivable.\nThere is then a legitimate argument about the role that America\u0027s support for Israel plays in advancing America\u0027s global interests. Here there is a good faith disagreement - but it is not a major one. I long subscribed to the view that the fundamental problem with the Middle East was the refusal of many Arab states to recognize the state of Israel. At some point, I should explain how and why the events of the last decade have educated me and complicated my view. This response is long enough not to go into all that now.\nBut I do believe that it is vital for the US to appeal to moderate Muslims across the world in order to isolate Islamist extremists, and I do believe that some kind of effort to jump-start the peace process in Israel-Palestine is critical to that. After watching how neoconservatism has actually - if unwittingly - empowered Islamism, I have come to see the wisdom of realism and calm in this matter. This was one central reason for my support of Obama.\nI do not think it was unreasonable for the new president, with a unique chance to reset relations with the Muslim world, to ask an ally to make a gesture to freeze all settlement construction in order to bring credibility back to the US as an honest broker in the Middle East. I also believe for good measure that this is in the interests of Israel, if I am allowed to offer an opinion on the matter without being called out as a false friend of \"the Jews\". I do believe that what Wieseltier himself delicately concedes were \"blunt tactics\" in Gaza, followed by a humiliation of president Obama in his first year of office were not the acts of a truly helpful ally of the US, especially when suspension of the settlement construction would have had zero effect on Israel\u0027s security. And I strongly disagree that when a struggle between a foreign country\u0027s government and the newly elected president of the United States cripples the peace process, it is somehow the president of the United States\u0027 fault.\nLook at this sentence from Wieseltier:\nIf “the Netanyahu government has all but declared war on the Obama administration,” it was after the Obama administration had all but declared war on the Netanyahu government. Obama may have been right about Netanyahu  the skepticism about the latter’s willingness to surrender land for a peace that will bring Palestine into being is not exactly fanciful  but Obama failed miserably, and set everything back.\nTo ask that Israel freeze all its settlement construction as a way to help facilitate peace is not declaring war on Netanyahu\u0027s government. It is simply assuming the US is capable of determining its own foreign policy in the region without a foreign government\u0027s advance permission. And notice that Wieseltier, in a convoluted fashion, does not exactly disagree on Netanyahu\u0027s intransigence. But all of this is always Obama\u0027s failure because it can never be Israel\u0027s fault because to say that anything is Israel\u0027s fault is anti-Semitic. Lovely piece of circular logic there, innit? Unless and until the president of the US recognizes that policy toward the Middle East must always be subject to Israel\u0027s interests and sensitivities before anything else, it is the American president\u0027s failure. Israel can never be blamed. I\u0027m sorry but I disagree. I think Israel can be blamed and its intransigence should be exposed and criticized forthrightly - or, of course, defended - in Washington without this looming threat of the anti-Semite card being hauled out.\nAnd this, it seems to me, must be the occasion for this rather sad attempt at character assassination. All those who dissent one iota from whatever excruciatingly arcane position Wieseltier carves out for himself at any given moment must be set up for character assassination. The first card to be used is the anti-Semitic card. It is, apparently, the responsibility of every non-Jewish or even Jewish writer who is not Leon Wieseltier to tread an extremely careful linguistic path, to walk delicately through a minefield of traps, to remain permanently fearful of being tarred as a bigot if he or she dares question the line that alone Wieseltier polices.\nLook, I am not one to dismiss any notion of anti-Semitism in me or anyone else. I believe it is such a toxic theme in human history and such a grave strain in the human soul that no one should be sublimely confident that he or she is free of it entirely. I take the moral demand to guard against it very seriously. And I have indeed searched my conscience these past few years to take stock if anything like this is unconsciously entering my soul, as I try to guard against my many other sins. I certainly think I have written and thought some things about Muslims and Arabs over the years that are not always carefully parsed, conditioned or measured. I\u0027m not immune to homophobia either. Our psyches are complex. As I said, Irish blood and a Catholic conscience are not easy bedfellows. And I can parry a little hard in the cut and thrust of debate sometimes.\nAt his most generous, Wieseltier accuses me of moronic insensitivity. Well, I do not think Leon thinks I am a moron. Am I insensitive? At times, I\u0027m sure I am. I\u0027m a writer who doesn\u0027t much care for political correctness, of policing discourse for every single possible trope or code that someone somewhere will pounce on as evidence of bigotry. I\u0027ve gone out of my way as an editor and writer to stir things up - on race and gender and culture and sex - and I have never been one to worry excessively about the sensitivity of others. I think I have offended and enraged far far more gay men and evangelicals than I ever have Jewish-Americans, for example. I\u0027m a South Park devotee, for Pete\u0027s sake.\nBut you will note that Wieseltier himself peppers his own prose with statements about \"the Jews\" as if they are some collective, monolithic mass. You will note how he interchangeably refers to Israelis, liberal Jewish-Americans, conservative Jewish-Americans, orthodox and reform, Democratic and Republican, settlers and non-settlers, Likudniks and peaceniks and Lord knows who else as \"the Jews.\" It is a sleight of hand reserved for him alone, and a statement that no one else can enter this debate on the same terms without obeying his rules of discourse or face some kind of ostracism or vilification.\nBut I will note one sentence Wieseltier writes at the beginning of this unedited rant. It refers to the Holy Trinity and the Incarnation, a profound mystery to Christians, and at the heart of our faith. He writes this:\n\"The idea of plurality in the deity, like the idea of corporeality in the deity (Auden would not have had an easier time with the Incarnation!), represents nothing less than a retraction of the monotheistic revolution in thinking about God, a reversal of God’s sublimity, a regress to polytheistic crudity.\"\nLeon is describing the central tenets of the Christian faith - the divinity of Jesus and the Triune God - as a step backward for religious thinking. He is dismissing as stupid and backward the Incarnation. He goes so far as to insult it by decrying it as a regress to polytheism. And not just polytheism but crude polytheism.\nI am not one to take offense at such things. My own faith can withstand the cheap pot-shots of others. But can you imagine if Wieseltier came across a Muslim or a Christian making similar derogatory and condescending and cheap remarks about Judaism? As crude? A form of religious regression?\nYes, of course, you can.\n","source":"google_52778141428876"}

The new tagline, “The Earth to Business Company,” is a clear signal ERDAS wants to be a more aggressive player in the enterprise geospatial market. Unshackling itself from the Leica name allows the company to develop a stronger, more focused software brand. Read more in this report from Editor-in-chief Joe Francica.\nEditors Note: For this exclusive report, Directions Magazine Editor-in-chief Joe Francica met with ERDAS President Bob Morris and his executive team on March 27th to be briefed on changes ongoing at the company, as well as receive product updates. ERDAS provided travel expenses to Directions to facilitate this report.\nLeica Geosystems Geospatial Imaging announced today that it is rebranding the company as ERDAS and will add as their tagline, \"The Earth to Business Company,\" a clear signal that it wants to be a more aggressive player in the enterprise geospatial market. Unshackling itself from the Leica brand allows the company to develop a stronger software persona instead of being defined by a name more closely associated with a superior optical system. As such, it will leverage the ERDAS name, the moniker of the company it acquired in 2001, and of its flagship image processing software that has been in existence since 1978.\nLeica Geosystems Geospatial Imaging, now ERDAS, took a hard look at the current developments and disruption in the geospatial marketplace over the last three years and set a course to acquire technology and experience that would make it a more complete geospatial solution provider. By acquiring IONIC, ER Mapper and Acquis during the past 12 months, ERDAS bought technology that will allow it to manage larger and more complex data, both raster and vector, to solve any business challenge in most any industry sector. In short, the company is looking to be recognized as a viable alternative to the current geospatial solution providers.\nBackground\nERDAS had been playing largely in a world of photogrammetric data capture and image processing of remotely sensed satellite and airborne data. The company believed that it was not viable in the total geospatial arena of GIS and enterprise platforms. In addition, the company felt that it needed to develop solutions in the emerging 3D market and process data from any sensor device. As it was, the former Leica Geosystems group was gaining approximately a 5% market share in what it believed was a $1.1 billion market. The Leica brand did not provide much additional market value in the geospatial solution space, while the ERDAS name had strong notoriety with global desktop deployments and more than 40,000 customers.\nSince being acquired by Hexagon in 2005, Leica Geosystems various divisions were developing products primarily for industries in measurement technologies and precision tools. Those groups will remain under the Leica branding, in particular, its well-established place in surveying and construction. But to be number one or two in each industry sector, Hexagon was interested in further developing each groups identity and making sure that it could maintain its goal of reaching 15% growth in earnings per share each year.\nThe Roadmap\nIn order to implement its goal to better serve the geospatial market, ERDAS had to establish a roadmap to deliver enterprise solutions. The basic underlying philosophy of the company was, and is, to build a unified enterprise platform with a services oriented architecture (SOA) infrastructure. This was the primary reason for acquiring IONIC.\nThis architecture, ERDAS believes, will allow it to address a variety of client applications including those that ingest and process geospatial data from various sensor and mobile platforms, offer analytical solutions using rule-based applications, provide the ability to crawl databases for feature data and imagery; and invoke models for geoprocessing. In support of this framework are the acquisitions the company had made that include: Acquis, for better vector data handling and managing data stores; ER Mapper, to supply compression and image server technology, as well as access to the oil and gas market; IONIC, the backbone for enterprise solutions and adherence to Open Geospatial Consortium web services specifications, as well as a client framework to build web portals. The result is a solution value chain that includes the ability to author or capture data (through products like ERDAS IMAGINE [SEE MORE BELOW] and LPS), manage data (IONICs Red Spider), connect to in-house or share data sources ( TITAN [SEE MORE BELOW] ), and deliver data (ER Mappers Image Web Server and IONICs RedSpider Web).\nRoadmap Implementation\nOur objective is to develop a comprehensive geospatial business system for managing, analyzing and delivering data and information products, said Bob Morris, president of ERDAS. We have all these tools but how do we bring them all together? Morris asked rhetorically. The company recognizes that its existing customers represent a smaller niche of the total geospatial market that includes data providers, GIS service providers, airborne sensing, national mapping agencies, as well as state and local government clients. To reach a different audience, including urban planners, real estate professionals, environmental consultants, land developers and others, a new product development strategy is necessary. The remedy is for ERDAS to embark on a multi-level project that will span four phases to build a comprehensive geospatial business system.\nPhase I  ERDAS Image Manager\nEnterprise image management was the objective of this first phase while kicking off different development threads. Using an agile development strategy, ERDAS Image Manager addresses the problem of discovering, describing, cataloging and serving image data.\nPhase II\nThe objective in this phase is to provide an integrated web toolkit and bring that into the mix to offer server based geoprocessing. Supporting additional sensor models and working with OGC specifications are also key ingredients.\nPhase III\nHere, extended enterprise data management using the Acquis Data Editor (ADE) takes center stage to provide full vector support, data store support, and interoperability with all desktop clients. In addition, mobile technology will be integrated and a complete web tool kit will be offered as well as transactional web feature services.\nPhase IV\nThe last phase of this project is focused on completing the enterprise-enabled geoprocessing, with 3D solutions integrated into a complete geospatial business platform.\nSummary\nThe bottom line on the rebranding effort for ERDAS is that the company felt it was not participating in the total geospatial market. As such, in order to capitalize on the market expansion, it needed to pursue technology through acquisition and develop solutions to address other markets and industries. It had an eye on aggressively attacking the highest growth markets in Brazil, Russia, India and China - the so-called BRIC countries. And in order to truly bring a comprehensive solution to market it must offer an architecture coincident with the mainstream information technology software.\nWill this new direction enable the company to compete against Intergraph, Autodesk, ESRI and others? ERDAS wants to be recognized among this group, whether in partnership or independently, to offer solutions. However, its stated direction is to bring a comprehensive approach to any business or organization. No longer does it wish to be seen solely as an image processing solution; with its acquisitions the company can now deliver an enterprise suite of tools.\nBut rebranding is never an easy exercise. Reeducating the market is especially challenging in an environment where the dominant voices in the information technology sector are also trying to carve a niche in the geospatial market. So, ERDAS has its work cut out for it - to rise above the din of an increasingly crowded field of heavyweights.\nMore on TITAN\nIn a previous article , Directions Magazine reviewed Leica TITAN (now ERDAS TITAN). Its official release was this past March. In brief, ERDAS positions TITAN as a geospatial data bridge, in other words, a way to share geospatial data and web services within a secure environment. It uses a globe metaphor to visualize information and employs a geospatial instant messenger (GeoIM) to stream data from one client to another. According to ERDAS, users of the GeoIM create a MyWorld, a geographically enabled personal space to upload data, set permissions and share content with other users in the network.\n","source":"google_52778141428876"}

In his new post, Mr. Dobbins could seek to work more aggressively with Tehran as the U.S. withdraws its forces in Afghanistan.\nMr. Dobbins will be a leading player in overseeing the end of the U.S. war in Afghanistan, Mr. Kerry said, and will also try to ease Washington’s fractious relationship with Pakistan, which holds important elections next year.\n“Jim will continue building on diplomatic efforts to bring the conflict [in Afghanistan] to a peaceful conclusion, actively engaging with states in the region and the international community,” Mr. Kerry said in his statement.\nMr. Dobbins has spent much of the past decade as a scholar at the Rand Corp. in Washington, where he’s written extensively on nation-building efforts.\n","source":"google_52778142620473"}

Dobbins has agreed to serve as the next Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan. He has deep and longstanding relationships in the region and I couldn’t be more grateful that Jim has agreed to take on this assignment.\nThis is a pivotal moment for both Afghanistan and Pakistan, with interconnected political, security, and economic transitions already underway in Afghanistan, and Pakistani elections just days away, marking an important and historic democratic transition.\nGiven my own history with both countries, and players throughout the region, identifying the right person for this position was a key priority.

He died December 13, 2010 while on the job as our top envoy to Afghanistan, and one can’t help thinking that whatever 1960′s idealism still existed in terms of making that country a better place, died with him. At least symbolically.\nThat is not to say that Richard “bulldozer” Holbrooke wasn’t a strident advocate for the use of military force — he was for sure, and I believe it was only to his and our ultimate detriment. But unlike his neoconservative cohorts in Washington, Holbrooke believed in starting wars ( Bosnia , Yugoslavia , Iraq ) as a matter of humanitarian intervention, not merely for “securing the realm” or for preserving “western interests.” That is not to say his positions on those wars were any better than those of his neocon peers, it’s merely a distinction, one being that humanitarian interventionists like Holbrooke and Hillary Clinton actually believed American power could transform societies. Neoconservatives, on the other hand, have shown time and again that while they are quite good at breaking things (and regimes), putting Humpty Dumpty back together again was never high on the priority list.\nI raise the spirit of Richard Holbrooke now because I heard an old clip of him speaking on P.O.T.U.S Radio on Wednesday, in tribute to his birthday. It referred to the day in 2009 he was named special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan, and there were a number of VIPs there to share in what was probably his last true moment in the sun. The radio spot tracked his Associated Press obituary , which noted his early service as a provincial representative for the U.S. Agency for International Development in South Vietnam and then as an aide to two U.S. ambassadors in Saigon during the Vietnam War:\nHolbrooke spotted an old friend in the audience, John Negroponte, his one-time roommate in Saigon (the former South Vietnamese capital now called Ho Chi Minh City) who later was the first director of national intelligence and a former U.S. ambassador to Iraq.\n“We remember those days well, and I hope we will produce a better outcome this time,” Holbrooke said.\nThis seems so sad, veering into Shakespearean territory. Here is man who spent his entire life grooming to be in a position to produce “a better outcome” than Vietnam, and then he helps, in essence, to duplicate it, by supporting a military invasion that ripped the fabric of Iraqi society apart and turned nearly every religious and ethnic group against us at some point during the last 10 years . The U.S spent trillions and strained its powerful military and sent millions of Iraqis fleeing — and to what end?\nBy the time the Bush Administration was on its way out and Holbrooke could have put his diplomatic skills to the test for a Democrat in Afghanistan, the world had unfortunately moved on. The military was everything, not just a means to getting men like Holbrooke to the negotiating table. The new president seemed happy to keep the military on this course, whether that was to hell in a hand basket didn’t appear to matter, as long as the brass got blamed and some kind of deadline for withdrawal could be achieved.\nSo, after a voluminous career that stretched back to the Kennedy Administration, Holbrooke found himself patronized and later ignored by the young whippersnapper President, who never seemed to let him flex his legendary skills to get the job done for “Af-Pak” the way he had presumably did for the Balkans. Afghan President Karzai appeared to hate him, preferring military men like Gen. Stanley McChrystal, who had gobs of fun at Holbrooke’s expense in 2010, right in front of Rolling Stone reporter Michael Hastings. McChrystal lost his job because of it, but Holbrooke looked very much the weaker man throughout the entire episode .\nWhile there is plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest that Holbrooke’s own ego didn’t do him any favors (more than once being called a ‘bull in a china shop’), making him as many enemies as friends during his 2009-2010 stint, one thing is clear: the military was (and remains) in control of the entire war and foreign policy effort in Af-Pak. The State Department as Holbrooke had known it was and is a shell of its former self — strangled by the petty bureaucracy at Foggy Bottom, subservient to the military mission, always begging for scraps at the trough.\nAnd the military was — and is — not negotiating. In fact, “negotiation” and “diplomacy” seem like quaint terms these days, right behind “Geneva Convention” and “law of war.” Depending on the “deal” the Obama Administration makes with Karzai for post-2014 military relations, the U.S could likely leave Afghanistan the same way it left Iraq, a country on the brink of disaster.\nHolbrooke seems to have sensed this was coming down the road, perhaps staring up at the future from his diminished perch had made him see things more clearly. James Mann, who wrote extensively about Holbrooke for his book The Obamians in 2012, quotes Holbrook’s wife, Katy Marton :\n“He thought that this (Afghanistan) could become Obama’s Vietnam,” she said. “Some of the conversations in the Situation Room reminded him of conversations in the Johnson White House. When he raised that, Obama didn’t want to hear it.”\nThere was even a question over his last words, the first reports being that he told his doctor “to stop this war.” The context in which he said this has been in dispute ( his doctor says it was made in “painful banter” as he awaited the surgery from which he never emerged, alive).\nIt was clear that the humiliation, his isolation, the failure of any way forward in Afghanistan had taken its toll, however, and was foremost on his mind when he collapsed. According to Mann’s well documented account:\nOn Sunday, Dec. 5, 2010, Richard Holbrooke played tennis on Long Island with Bill Drozdiak, the president of the American Council on Germany, a former foreign correspondent who became friendly with Holbrooke when both were living in Europe. They played for about an hour. Drozdiak thought Holbrooke seemed unusually pale, pudgy and out of shape, as if he’d been working too hard.\n Aft erward, they sat and talked. Holbrooke said he was in despair over his role in the administration. He simply could not establish a relationship with Obama, Holbrooke said. The president seemed remote and cold-blooded, at least in Holbrooke’s presence. And, as if that weren’t enough, Holbrooke’s problem wasn’t just with Obama: Holbrooke thought many in the White House were against him …\nThe following Friday, Holbrooke was at a meeting in Hillary Clinton’s State Department office when he suddenly became flushed and stricken with pain. He was taken to the State Department medical office, but collapsed and went by ambulance to George Washington University Hospital. He died there three days later of a ruptured aorta.\nWhat would Holbrooke say today, now that his idea of “humanitarian intervention” has been completely discarded in favor of targeted killing, covert “dirty” wars and yes, a relatively low urgency for the humans themselves. Would he justify it, especially if he were given a prestigious inside view? Should he own it, considering that he and his “muscular Democrats” had set the stage for this evolution in the 1990′s, and had supported Obama’s tough “counter-terrorism” approaches from the beginning?\nDaniel Ellsberg suggested in this interesting eulogy after Holbrooke’s death in 2010, that for as idealistic as Holbrooke was, his career came first. Perhaps the daily soul sacrifice working in the Obama Administration — for the scraps of condescension he got in return — was too much for the man. He must have known that the war enterprise was as dirty as it was doomed to failure, but he was committed to defending it nonetheless.\nBut we will never really know. We can safely say however, that this isn’t exactly the legacy Richard Holbrooke wanted to leave behind. Or this . Or this . In fact, it’s probably worse than he would have imagined.\n","source":"google_52778142620473"}

We do not expect any sustained broad-based commodity price gains.\"\nThe week ended on a more positive note however, following a strong US non-farm payrolls (NFP) report. The US Department of Labor reported on Friday that the US economy added a solid 165,000 jobs in April, well above market expectations.\nOIL: Prices faced a rollercoaster ride, falling sharply on weak Chinese data, before bouncing higher.\nCrude futures had tumbled by almost $2.5 on Wednesday as traders took their cue from fresh signs of economic weakness in the United States and China, and after a US inventory report showed crude stocks at their highest point in more than 30 years.\nHowever, the market then spiked by almost $3 on Thursday, and continued to head higher on Friday in the wake of the NFP numbers.\n\"Oil prices have been very closely linked with economic sentiment over the past couple of days, rising and falling in conjunction with how investors judged economic results,\" said analyst Gary Hornby at energy consultancy Inenco.\n\"Oil dropped back below $100 per barrel briefly after Chinese manufacturing PMI data came in worse than expected, before posting the largest daily rise in almost six months, to reach $103 a barrel, after the ECB cut interest rates and US weekly jobless claims fell to five-year lows.\"\nThursday\u0027s widely-expected quarter-point interest rate reduction, to a record low of 0.50 percent, is part of the ECB\u0027s efforts to help the debt-stricken eurozone escape from recession.

Rugaber\nPosted:   05/03/2013 08:03:47 AM PDT\nMay 3, 2013 3:9 PM GMTUpdated:   05/03/2013 08:07:02 AM PDT\nWASHINGTON -- The U.S. economy showed last month why it remains the envy of industrialized nations: In the face of tax increases and federal spending cuts, employers added a solid 165,000 jobs in April -- and far more in February and March than anyone thought.\nThe job growth in April drove down the unemployment rate to a four-year low of 7.5 percent and sent a reassuring sign that the U.S. job market is improving.\nIn its report Friday, the Labor Department revised up its estimate of job gains in February and March by a combined 114,000. It now says employers added 332,000 jobs in February and 138,000 in March. The economy has created an average of 208,000 jobs a month from November through April -- above the 138,000 added in the previous six months.\n\"This is a good report,\" said John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo. \"There\u0027s a lot of strength... It\u0027s good for the economy. It\u0027s good for people\u0027s income.\"\nThe stronger job growth suggests that the federal budget cutting \"does not mean recession,\" Silvia said. \"It does not mean a dramatic slowdown.\"\nStock prices soared when trading began on Wall Street at 9:30 a.m. Eastern time. The Dow was up 155 points in early trading.\nThe unemployment rate has fallen 0.4 percentage point since the start of the year, though it remains high. The Federal Reserve has said it plans to keep short-term interest rates at record lows at least until unemployment falls to 6.5 percent.\nAdvertisement\nThe hiring last month was broad-based. The only sectors of the economy that cut jobs were construction and government.\nSome higher-paying sectors added workers. Professional and technical services, which includes accounting, engineering and architecture, added 23,000 jobs. Education and health services added 44,000.\nBut some of the bigger job gains were in lower-paying fields, such as hotels and restaurants, which added 45,000 jobs, and retail, which added 29,000. Temporary help firms gained 31,000 positions.\nThe job growth is occurring while the U.S. economy is growing modestly but steadily. It expanded at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the January-March quarter, fueled by the strongest consumer spending in two years.\nThe global economy, by contrast, is slowing. The European Union warned Friday, for example, that the 17 countries that use the euro currency will shrink by a collective 0.4 percent this year. And unemployment across the eurozone is expected to hit an average of 12.2 percent. In Greece and Spain, it\u0027s forecast to reach 27 percent.\nBoth Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi have suggested that governments need to focus on stimulating growth and not just on spending cuts and deficit reduction.\nIn April, more Americans said they had part-time jobs even though they wanted full-time work. That figure rose 278,000 to 7.9 million, reversing a steep drop the previous month.\nSome economists worry that restaurants, retail chains and other companies are hiring more part-time workers in preparation for the implementation of health care reform. Companies with more than 50 full-time employees in 2013 will be required to provide health insurance to their full-time staff next year.\nThe revisions to the March and February figures were unusually large. Retailers, restaurants and hotels added 48,000 more jobs in February than previously reported. They accounted for three-quarters of that month\u0027s revision.\nThe government revises each month\u0027s job totals twice in the following two months. The revisions occur because many companies in the survey submit their responses late.\nThe average workweek for private-sector employees declined 0.2 hour to 34.4 hours, but average hourly earnings rose 4 cents to $23.87. In the past year, wages have risen faster than inflation.\nThe number of people who have been unemployed for more than six months dropped 258,000 to 4.4 million. Over the past year, the number of long-term unemployed has declined by 687,000. A fire overnight at the Labor Department\u0027s headquarters shut down the building for most employees. Members of the news media were allowed in for the release of the jobs report.\n","source":"google_52778141696863"}

Continue Reading\nâ€œAll things considered, 165,000 isnâ€™t the biggest monthly gain in payrolls youâ€™ll ever see, but itâ€™s enough to assuage concerns that the economy had stalled again,â€� said Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics.\nThe Labor Department revised upward its estimate of job gains in February and March by a combined 114,000. It now says employers added 332,000 jobs in February and 138,000 in March.\nThe economy has created an average of 208,000 jobs a month from November through April â€” well above the monthly average of 138,000 for the previous six months.\nThe job market is benefiting from a resurgent housing market, rising consumer confidence and the Federal Reserveâ€™s stimulus actions, which have helped lower borrowing costs and lift the stock market.\nThe unemployment rate edged down from 7.6 percent in March and has fallen 0.4 percentage point since the start of the year, though it remains high. The Fed has said it plans to keep short-term interest rates at record lows at least until unemployment falls to 6.5 percent.\nOne cautionary note in the employment report: Most of the biggest job gains were in lower-paying fields, such as hotels and restaurants, which added 45,000 jobs, and retail, which added 29,000. Temporary-help firms gained 31,000 positions.\nBy contrast, construction companies and governments cut jobs. Manufacturing employment was flat.\nSome higher-paying sectors added workers. Professional and technical services, which include accounting, engineering and architecture, added 23,000 jobs. Education and health services gained 44,000.\nAverage hourly pay rose, but the average workweek for private-sector employees dipped 0.2 hour to 34.4 hours. That meant average weekly paychecks declined.\nBut over the past year, total pay after adjusting for inflation is up a healthy 2.1 percent, economists said. That should help boost consumer spending in coming months.\nThe job growth is occurring while the U.S. economy is growing modestly but steadily. It grew at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the January-March quarter, fueled by the strongest consumer spending in two years.\nThe housing recovery is helping drive more hiring. Rising home sales and construction create jobs and increase spending on furniture, landscaping and other services.\nOne company that has benefited is SolarCity, based in San Mateo, Calif. Rising home building has helped increase demand for the solar-power systems the company installs in homes and businesses.\nCEO Lyndon Rive said SolarCity added 177 jobs in April and will welcome its 3,000th employee Monday. It is hiring engineers, installers and administrative support staff and still has 400 openings.\nConsumers have been spending more even though their take-home pay was shrunk this year by a Social Security tax increase. On top of that, the economy has been under pressure from the across-the-board government spending cuts that began taking effect March 1. And some small and midsize companies are concerned about new requirements under the federal health care law.\nAmericansâ€™ confidence in the economy jumped last month, lifted by a brighter outlook for hiring and expectations for higher pay, according to the Conference Board, a research group. Cheaper gasoline, the booming stock market and rising home values are also no doubt making people more confident.\nHome prices rose 9.3 percent in February compared with a year ago, the most in nearly seven years, according to the Standard \u0026 Poorâ€™s/Case-Shiller 20-city index.\nStill, prices nationwide remain about 30 percent below their peak during the housing bubble in 2006. Theyâ€™re back only to where they were in 2003.\nYet the global economy, by contrast, is slowing. The European Union warned Friday, for example, that the 17 countries that use the euro will shrink by a collective 0.4 percent this year. And unemployment in the eurozone is expected to hit an average of 12.2 percent. In Greece and Spain, it is forecast to reach 27 percent.\nIn April, more Americans said they had part-time jobs even though they wanted full-time work. That figure rose 278,000 to 7.9 million, reversing a steep drop the previous month.\nSome economists worry that restaurants, retailers and other companies are hiring more part-timers in preparation for the start of health care reform. Companies with more than 50 full-time employees in 2013 will be required to provide health insurance to their full-time staff next year.\nThe revisions to the March and February figures were unusually large. Retailers, restaurants and hotels added 48,000 more jobs in February than previously reported. They accounted for three-quarters of that monthâ€™s revision.\nThe government revises each monthâ€™s job totals twice in the following two months. The revisions occur because many companies in the survey submit their responses late.\nFridayâ€™s report said the number of people who have been unemployed for more than six months dropped 258,000 to 4.4 million. Over the past year, the number of long-term unemployed has declined by 687,000.\nSome analysts cautioned that Aprilâ€™s job gains donâ€™t necessarily point to faster hiring ahead.\nâ€œThere is little sign in these data to suggest that a marked acceleration in monthly job creation in the months ahead is in the cards,â€� said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West.\n***\nLONDON (AP) â€” Stock markets rallied on Friday, with both the Dow and S\u0026P hitting new highs, after an unexpectedly strong U.S. jobs report indicated the worldâ€™s largest economy is not slowing down, as some had feared.\nThe Labor Department said a net 165,000 jobs were created in April, above the market expectations for 140,000. The previous two monthsâ€™ weak figures, meanwhile, were revised up. That helped bring the unemployment rate down to 7.5 percent, the lowest in four years.\nPaul Ashworth, the chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics, said the report â€œwill go a long way towards soothing fears of another spring slowdown.â€�\nOn Wall Street, the Dow was up 1.1 percent to 14,991.93, having earlier traded above the 15,000 mark for the first time. The broader S\u0026P 500 was 1.2 percent higher at 1,616.89, also just off record highs.\nIn Europe, Germanyâ€™s DAX rose 2 percent to 8,122.29, its highest ever closing price. Britainâ€™s FTSE 100 closed 0.9 percent higher at 6,521.46 while Franceâ€™s CAC-40 ended 1.4 percent higher at 3,912.95.\nThe U.S. jobs report helped offset news that the European Union had downgraded its economic forecasts. In its spring update, the EU said it expected the 17-country eurozoneâ€™s economy to shrink 0.4 percent this year, 0.1 percentage points worse than its February prediction.\nIt expects markedly weaker growth in Germany, the regionâ€™s biggest economy, and a contraction in France, the second-largest. The fact that the economic slowdown is affecting the larger economies could push the ECB to cut interest rates again, or provide some new measures of support to credit markets in coming months.\nEarlier, in Asia, Hong Kongâ€™s Hang Seng rose 0.1 percent to close at 22,689.96. South Koreaâ€™s Kospi rose 0.4 percent to 1,965.71 and Australiaâ€™s S\u0026P/ASX 200 was nearly unchanged at 5,129.50.\nMainland Chinese stocks posted sharp gains, but that was likely due to bargain-hunting after a sharp fall the day before. The Shanghai Composite Index jumped 1.4 percent to 2,205.5 while the Shenzhen Composite Index gained 2 percent to 936.58.\nMarkets in Japan were closed for a public holiday.\nIn commodity markets, the benchmark oil contract for June delivery was up $1.80 to $95.79 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose $2.96, or 3.3 percent, on Thursday, the biggest one-day gain for crude since November.\nIn currencies, the euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.3110, recovering somewhat from sharp losses the day before, when the European Central Bank on Thursday cut interest rates. The dollar rose 1.2 percent against the Japanese yen, to 99.12 yen.\n","source":"google_52778141696863"}

The Standard and Poor\u0027s 500 index, a broader market measure, passed 1,600 for the first time, closing closed at 1,614.42, up 16.83 for the day.\n\"The market investors were positioned for a disappointing report,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist with Moody\u0027s Analytics. \"So when we got the bigger number, and the revisions, and, of course, we are in a bull market, so everyone just piled in.\"\nThe government said 11.7 million people remained unemployed, and those looking for work probably are frustrated, but Zandi said many investors were relieved.\n\"They were pleasantly surprised, and given that investors are already very, very bullish for lots of different reasons, the market has taken off,\" Zandi said.\nStay Connected\nGet the latest newsletter delivered to your email.

With these revisions, employment gains in February and March combined were 114,000 higher than earlier reported, the government said.\nIn April, the number of persons employed part-time for economic reasons - sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers - increased by 278,000 to 7.9 million.\n\"The only blemish in the report, and it\u0027s not inconsequential, is the average weekly hours worked declined 0.2 hours,\" to 34.4 hours, Zandi said. \"That\u0027s a large decline, and it\u0027s in large part because of a big move to part-time employment involuntarily.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly traded above 15,000 for the first time. The Standard \u0026 Poor\u0027s 500 Index joined the rally and breached 1,600 for the first time. The dollar climbed more than 1 percent against the yen\nExpectations ran low ahead of Friday\u0027s report because the American economy is digesting a new round of tax increases and federal spending cuts, known in Washington shorthand as sequestration. The report soothed worries that belt-tightening in Washington, combined with a downturn in Europe and China, would throw the brakes on hiring.\n\"The U.S. labor market showed more resilience in April,\" said Scott Anderson, chief economist in San Francisco at Bank of the West. \"This bolsters the case that the U.S. economic expansion will be able to survive the combined headwinds of sequestration and a deepening recession in Europe in the months ahead.\"\nOther indicators remain mixed and few economists appear willing to forecast with any certainty that the outlook will remain upbeat throughout the rest of the year. For the time being, however, most felt reassured, even if the gains last month were merely modest.\nAll the hiring in April took place in the private sector. By the standards of past recoveries, the estimated 176,000 new positions is merely enough to absorb population growth and new graduates entering the labor market for the first time. The April figure even falls well below the 232,000 monthly average in the last three months of 2012. But it was on par for an slow but steady recovery that has added private-sector jobs for 38 consecutive months.\nGovernment sheds jobs\nThe government remains a drag on job creation, shedding an estimated 11,000 jobs at the federal and local levels during the month. Gains in the private sector and losses in the government sector meant the economy added an estimated 165,000 non-farm jobs in April.\nEven more important were the revisions for the previous two months. Total non-farm payrolls rose by 138,000 jobs in March, 50,000 more than previously estimated, and job growth for February was revised up by 64,000 to 332,000, the largest gain since May 2010.\nMonthly government jobs data are notorious for imprecise preliminary estimates and major retroactive revisions. The government derives its monthly unemployment rate from a survey of American households, but only counts those as unemployed if they are looking for work while those who give up out of discouragement disappear from the civilian labor force and drop out of the statistics. The government collects payroll data from a separate sampling of employers.\nThe unemployment rate fell to 7.5% from 7.6% in March and 7.9% in January. It had peaked at 10% in October 2009 and fallen in fits and starts since then. Unlike the decline in March, which resulted from discouraged workers abandoning their jobs search, the unemployment rate fell in April \"for the right reasons\" - because more found jobs, said Abdur Chowdhury, economics professor at Marquette University.\nCombing through the April data, however, also reveals once again the weakness of the current recovery.\nThe official count of unemployed is 11.7 million, with 37% categorized as long-term unemployed because they have gone without work for over half a year. But those figures do not include another 2.3 million unemployed who had given up looking for work, which removed them from the main statistic. Nor does it count another 7.9 million who found part-time work but need full-time wages, a classification known as \"involuntary part-time workers.\"\nAnd fewer Americans as a share of the population are working than at any time in 35 years. In the wake of the recession, corporations employ continue to employ fewer than they did in the pre-crisis period. As a result, the employment-to-population ratio has collapsed to 63.6%, a level not seen since 1978.\nAnd many of the new jobs in April come from lower-paying sectors like retail, restaurants, hotels and food services. Stores hired 29,000 workers, while restaurants added 38,000 employees. Temporary help services added 31,000.\nThe manufacturing sector, a major locomotive of employment in Wisconsin, was unchanged at the national level in April. Accurate state-level figures for manufacturing will not be due for several months.\nEconomists have been warning that the economy will slow in the second-quarter, and drag hiring lower. Payroll taxes increased in January. And automatic, across-the-board spending cuts went into effect in March. And if the mandated spending cuts continue, many reckon that the impact of the spending cuts is expected to be felt more broadly in the months ahead.\n\"We\u0027ll still have slow, but positive growth,\" said Brian Jacobsen at Wells Fargo Bank in Menomonee Falls. \"The dreaded sequester didn\u0027t show up in the employment situation report, but it could be more noticeable in May\u0027s report.\"\n© 2013 , Journal Sentinel Inc.

That’s still slow growth by historic standards, but it marks the fifth consecutive month of gains after a topsy turvy year in 2012.\nDuring the month, roughly the same number of employers (13 percent) cut jobs and added jobs , though collectively, the latter group added more positions that the downsizers lost—thus the slight overall increase in small business employment.\nRelated: Do small businesses actually create jobs?\nTheir contributions mirror the slow but increasingly consistent progress of the broader economic recovery, as the country added 165,000 jobs in April, according to the Labor Department, which also boosted its previous estimates for February and March. The unemployment rate dropped to 7.5 percent, too.\n“April was another positive, albeit lackluster month for job creation,” NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg said in a statement. “But small-business owners are expressing a bit more enthusiasm in hiring plans in the months to come.”\nIndeed, the group’s job creation reading showed major signs of improvement last month, as the number of business owners expecting to add jobs in the next three months jumped 3 percentage points to 18 percent and the number planning to trim their staffs dropped one point to only 4 percent.\nA similar survey by Intuit showed similar trends, with small business employment jumping 0.11 percent as employers added about 20,000 new jobs. Compared to last year, that’s 0.9 percent growth. Some of the largest employment gains came from companies out west, with states like California, Idaho and Utah posting small business job growth of more than 0.15 percent in April.\n“The West South Central census division, dominated by Texas, has been leading the recovery overall, reaching nearly the same level of employment as in mid-2008,” Susan Woodward, an economist who helped build the small business index, said in a statement.\nHowever, the numbers were not all rosy. The Intuit survey showed that both small business wages and hours worked by employees dropped in April, suggesting employers may simply be finding other ways to trim their payrolls besides cutting workers.\nMeanwhile, more than three out of four business owners with job openings reported finding few or no qualified applicants for those positions, according to the NFIB report— which may hinder some of the growth plans of those 18 percent of firms that plan to hire in the next three months.\n","source":"google_52778141696863"}

The jobless rate also fell to 7.5 percent, the lowest since December 2008, the Labor Department said on Friday.\n\"Everyone was set up for a more gloomy employment report given the recent run of economic data and the chatter about the Fed possibly increasing the size of their purchases,\" said Jeffrey Cleveland, a senior economist at Payden \u0026 Rygel in Los Angeles.\nThe Federal Reserve said on Wednesday it may increase or decrease bond purchase from its current $85 billion per month, depending on the strength of the economy and on inflation. Before a recent slew of more negative data, economists had been expecting the Fed to taper its purchases heading into year-end.\nFriday\u0027s positive jobs surprise sent benchmark 10-year note yields up 13 basis points as investors reevaluated the strength of the economic recovery. Fears that growth is slowing sharply has helped pull benchmark 10-year yields down by 46 basis points in the past two months.\nTen-year notes yields were last at 1.75 percent, up from 1.62 percent on Thursday. It is the biggest single-day jump since Sept. 14, the day after the Federal Reserve launched its latest stimulus program that included adding $40 billion a month in purchases of mortgage-backed debt.\n\"It\u0027s a huge move for the ranges we\u0027ve been in,\" said Charles Comiskey, head of Treasurys trading at Bank of Nova Scotia in New York. \"The market feels heavy, people were caught offside, there\u0027s definitely been some selling here.\"\nSome traders were still reluctant to read too much into the jobs figure, however, as other economic indicators still point to slowing growth and as inflation holds much lower than the Fed\u0027s target of around 2 percent.\nThat makes it likely that the Fed\u0027s bond purchases are likely to continue for some time yet.\n\"The Fed is focused on the economy, growth and jobs, but they are also looking at a situation of possible disinflation, maybe heading towards deflation. That has been their biggest fear for a long time,\" said Comiskey.\nThe yield increases should add to demand for next week\u0027s auctions, as some analysts had worried that low coupons before today\u0027s data would scare away some fund managers.\nThe Treasury will sell $32 billion in three-year notes on Tuesday, $24 billion in 10-year notes on Wednesday and $16 billion in 30-year bonds on Thursday.\nThe Fed will purchase Treasurys every day next week as part of its ongoing purchase program, including between $2.75 billion and $3.50 billion in notes due 2020 to 2023 on Monday.\nUS Treasury Yields\n","source":"google_52778141696863"}

The Standard and Poor\u0027s 500 index closed above 1,600 for the first time.\nThe Dow rose 142.38 points to close at 14,973.96, up 1 percent. The S\u0026P 500 index surged 16.83 points, or 1 percent, to 1,614.42.\nA surprisingly strong job report set it all off. U.S. employers added 165,000 new workers in April and many more in February and March than previously estimated. The unemployment rate fell to the lowest level in four years, 7.5 percent.\nThe surge in U.S. hiring comes after weeks of conflicting signals about the strength of the global economy. The unexpectedly strong numbers jolted markets higher from the start of trading.\nOn the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, brokers sported baseball caps emblazoned with \"Dow 15,000.\"\nThe gains were broad. Eight of the 10 industry groups in the S\u0026P 500 index rose. Nearly three stocks rose for every one that fell on the NYSE.\nCompanies that stand to benefit most from an upturn in the economy led the stock market up. Those that make basic materials and produce oil and gas rose the most in the S\u0026P 500 index. U.S. Steel, General Electric and Dow Chemical were among the winners. Utilities, consumer-staple companies and other safe-play stocks trailed the market as investors took on more risk.\nSmall-company stocks are more risky than bigger companies but can also offer investors greater returns. On Friday, they outpaced the broader market. The Russell 2000 jumped 14.57 points, or 1.6 percent, to 954.42, a new all-time high.\nThe Nasdaq composite index rose 38.01 points to 3,378.63, an increase of 1.1 percent.\n\"We\u0027re breaking through psychological barriers and that will continue to bring investors off the sidelines,\" said Darrell Cronk, regional chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank. He called the jobs news \"wonderful.\"\nFor more than a month, investors have had to wrestle with worrying reports on the world economy. First came news of falling retail sales in March, then a series of weak manufacturing reports and signs of an economic slowdown in China.\nThe first-quarter earnings season has been mixed, too. Though earnings have been higher than expected, many companies have reported little or no revenue growth, which has spooked investors.\nInvestors have also been concerned that higher Social Security payroll taxes and sweeping government spending cuts that took effect earlier this year will slow U.S. economic growth, and pinch corporate profits.\nFriday\u0027s jobs numbers suggested the private sector might be strong enough to overcome those various obstacles.\nIn its report, the government revised its previous estimate of job gains up to 332,000 in February and 138,000 in March. The economy has created an average of 208,000 jobs a month from November through April – above the 138,000 added in the previous six months.\n\"Jobs are key,\" said Randall Warren, chief investment officer of Warren Financial Service in Exton, Penn. \"Everyone is worried about things like fiscal policy, the government spending money it doesn\u0027t have. If you want to turn that situation around, you have to get people off their couches.\"\nStock overseas rose on U.S. jobs report, too.

Crude rose sharply Thursday after the European Central Bank cut its key interest rate to a new low and weekly U.S. unemployment benefit claims dropped.

RUGABER | Associated Press –  Wed, May 1, 2013 4:25 PM EDT\nPrint\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Unemployment rates fell in nearly 90 percent of large U.S. cities in March, though most of the declines likely occurred because more Americans stopped looking for work, rather than found jobs.\nThe Labor Department says unemployment rates fell in 333 of the 372 largest metro areas. They rose in 22 and were unchanged in 17.\nNationwide, the unemployment rate dipped to 7.6 percent in March from 7.7 percent in February. Fewer people said they were unemployed, but only because they gave up on their job hunts. The government only counts people as unemployed if they are actively looking for work.\nHiring slowed sharply. Employers added only 88,000 jobs in March, a steep drop from the average gains of 188,000 a month in the preceding six months.\nStill, there were signs of long-term improvement in the metro unemployment data. Nearly 160 metro areas had unemployment rates of 7 percent or below, up from 113 a year earlier.\nAnd while 44 cities still have unemployment rates of 10 percent or higher, that\u0027s down from 63 a year earlier.\nThe metro unemployment data isn\u0027t seasonally adjusted for trends like the hiring of extra retail employees over the winter holidays. As a result, it can be more volatile than the national data.\nThe metro area with the biggest decline in unemployment in March from February was Blacksburg-Christiansburg, Va., where the rate fell to 5.6 percent from 7 percent. It was followed by Florence-Muscle Shoals, Ala., where the rate fell to 6.4 percent from 7.7 percent.\nThe next biggest drops were in Panama City-Lynn Haven, Fla.; Myrtle Beach, S.C.; and Springfield, Ill.\nThe metro area with the biggest increase was Baton Rouge, La., where it rose to 5.8 percent from 5.5 percent. Next was Bowling Green, Ky., where the rate increased by almost the same proportion: to 7.8 percent from 7.4 percent.\nThey were followed by Lubbock, Texas; Lake Charles, La.; and Lawrence, Kan.\nThe lowest unemployment rate was in Midland, Texas, at 3.1 percent. Midland displaced Bismarck, N.D., which has frequently boasted the lowest rate in the nation, largely because of the oil and gas drilling boom in that state. Bismarck\u0027s rate was 3.6 percent.\nYuma, Ariz., and El Centro, Calif., had the highest unemployment rates, at 26 percent and 23.7 percent, respectively. The two areas are adjacent and include a large number of migrant farm workers.\n@yahoofinance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook\nRelated Content\n","source":"google_52778141696863"}

Daniel Gross on why the dip will look even better in hindsight.\nThe U.S. economy continues to steam ahead amid turbulent seas. Or at least thatâ€™s my takeaway from Friday morningâ€™s job report .\nThe economy added 165,000 payroll jobs in Aprilâ€”good, but not great, though better than many analysts expected. Strength was seen in business and professional services (73,000 new jobs), food and drinking establishments (38,000), and retail (29,000). You donâ€™t need to have a Ph.D. in economics to understand how more people working at more jobs for slightly more pay leads to increased demand, which in turn leads to hiring. Compared with a year ago, then, there are 2.077 million more Americans with payroll jobs. Thatâ€™s not enough to claw back all the jobs lost in 2008 and 2009â€”the last time there were this many private-sector workers was back in September 2008, before the Lehman Brothers crisis. But the jobs numbers are moving in the right direction.\nA job seeker (left) meets with a recruiter during a job fair at the Alameda County Office of Education in Hayward, California, in April. (Justin Sullivan/Getty)\nThe unemployment rate, which is calculated from the separate Bureau of Labor Statistics household survey, fell from 7.6 percent in March to 7.5 percent in April. Now, in past months, analysts have been quick to dismiss declines in the unemployment rate when the decline is a function of people leaving the labor force. (After all, if the labor force declines, the unemployment rate could fall even if the number of people who say theyâ€™re working stays the same.) But in fact, in April the labor force grew by more than 200,000 from March. And it is up by nearly 800,000 from a year ago. More people are looking for work and more people are finding it. The number of people in the household survey reporting themselves as being employed rose by 291,000 in April.\nWhile it looks pretty good at first blush, the April jobs figure is likely to look even better in hindsight. After reporting the monthly figure, the BLS then revises the figure in each of the next two months. And since the economy began growing again in 2009, the trend has generally been for BLS to revise these figures higher. Justin Wolfers of the University of Michigan noted that over the course of 2010, BLS added 480,000 jobs through such revisions, 340,000 in 2011, and 330,000 in 2012. So far, this year is no different. The February figure, originally reported as 236,000, was revised upward to 268,000 in March. Today, the BLS revised that figure up to an impressive 332,000. Marchâ€™s payroll-jobs figure, originally reported as an anemic gain of 88,000, was revised to 136,000. In effect, BLS discovered an additional 114,000 jobs in the economy.\nOne of the majorâ€”and frustratingâ€”features of this recovery has been that capital is beating the living daylights out of labor.   \nThe jobs growth is good. But wage growth is less impressive. One of the majorâ€”and frustratingâ€”features of this recovery has been that capital is beating the living daylights out of labor. Companies have been able to rack up record profits and are demanding that employers work harder and more productively without necessarily paying them more. Why? Thereâ€™s a lot of slack in the labor force, unions have declined in power, and thereâ€™s a pervasive sense among CEOs that they just donâ€™t need to pay more. This trend continued last month. â€œIn April,â€� BLS noted, â€œaverage hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose by 4 cents to $23.87. Over the year, average hourly earnings have risen by 45 cents, or 1.9 percent.â€� Thatâ€™s weak. And we are nearing a point where we will really need companies to start giving it up if the expansion is going to continue.\nWhy? Well, fiscal policyâ€”the sequester, declining defense spending, higher taxesâ€”is now acting as a drag on the economy. April was the first full month in which the effects of the sequester would be seen in employment. The federal government cut 8,000 jobs in April. More broadly, what Iâ€™ve dubbed the â€œconservative recoveryâ€� is still intact. Each month for the past three years, the private sector has added positions, and each month for the last three years, the public sectorâ€”federal, state, and local governmentâ€”cuts jobs.\nThis dynamic usually doesnâ€™t happen in an economic expansion. But itâ€™s been going on for a few years thanks to austerity at the federal level and the continual needs of state and local governments to balance their budgets. In April, while the private sector added 176,000 jobs, the public sector cut 11,000 jobsâ€”8,000 from federal payrolls, 1,000 from state payrolls, and 2,000 from local government payrolls. The budget picture may be improving across the country, but itâ€™s not leading to more government employment yet. Since February 2010, the private sector has added 6.78 million jobs. Since May 2010, the public sector has cut 1.147 million jobs.\nSome call it socialism.\nDaniel Gross is a columnist and global business editor at Newsweek Daily Beast.\nFor inquiries, please contact The Daily Beast at editorial@thedailybeast.com.\nTags:\n","source":"google_52778141696863"}

While this figure shattered economic predictions, hiring only seems to be happening for just one segment of the overall population: Women workers, with their unemployment rate at 6.7 percent, were the largest number of job seekers to become employed in April.\nYet, Black job seekers arenâ€™t the only group to feel the unemployment crunch.\nAdult men (7.1 percent), teenagers (24.1 percent), Whites (6.7 percent), Hispanics (9.0 percent), and Asians (5.1 percent) all saw little change in their numbers when compared with the Labor Departmentâ€™s past statistics. The largest boon to the workforce happened in restaurants and bars, which added 38,000 jobs and retailers, which had the next highest number of hires with 29,000.\nSequestration also played a factor in this most-recent jobs report, with 11,000 federal, state, and local government workers losing their jobs due to budget constraints and other factors.\nIn all, 11.7 million people are out of work, a staggering rate when compared to the unemployment rate sitting at 4.5 percent before the recession shattered the economy.\nOut of necessity, part-time work is the only part of the workforce showing the strongest improvement, with many workers forced to take piecemeal jobs to make ends meet.\nThe report reveals that Blacks and Hispanics are hardest hit by joblessness, signaling a fact well-known in those communities that jobs for those groups are harder to come by.\nAlthough this disparity has been documented in detail over the years, little has been done to address the wide gap between Whites and people of color in todayâ€™s job market.\nRead the details of the Labor Departmentâ€™s jobs report here .\nSound off!\n","source":"google_52778141696863"}

RUGABER, AP Economics Writer Post-Bulletin Company, LLC\nWASHINGTON â€” The U.S. economy showed last month why it remains the envy of industrialized nations: In the face of tax increases and federal spending cuts, employers added a solid 165,000 jobs in April â€” and far more in February and March than anyone thought.\nThe job growth in April drove down the unemployment rate to a four-year low of 7.5 percent and sent a reassuring sign that the U.S. job market is improving. Coming after a poor jobs report for March, the figures the government issued Friday helped ease fears that U.S. hiring might be slumping this spring for a fourth straight year.\nThe Labor Department revised up its estimate of job gains in February and March by a combined 114,000. It now says employers added 332,000 jobs in February and 138,000 in March. The economy has created an average of 208,000 jobs a month from November through April â€” above the 138,000 added in the previous six months.\n\"This is a good report,\" said John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo. \"There\u0027s a lot of strength... It\u0027s good for the economy. It\u0027s good for people\u0027s income.\"\nThe stronger job growth suggests that the federal budget cutting \"does not mean recession,\" Silvia said. \"It does not mean a dramatic slowdown.\"\nStock prices soared in response. The Dow was up about 150 points in midafternoon trading and briefly touched 15,000 for the first time.\nThe unemployment rate has fallen 0.4 percentage point since the start of the year, though it remains high. The Federal Reserve has said it plans to keep short-term interest rates at record lows at least until unemployment falls to 6.5 percent.\nThe hiring last month was concentrated in services. Construction companies and governments cut jobs. Home builders added staff, while commercial construction companies cut. Manufacturing employment was flat.\nSome higher-paying sectors added workers. Professional and technical services, which includes accounting, engineering and architecture, added 23,000 jobs. Education and health services added 44,000.\nOne cautionary note in the April employment report: Most of the biggest job gains were in lower-paying fields, such as hotels and restaurants, which added 45,000 jobs, and retail, which added 29,000. Temporary-help firms gained 31,000 positions.\nAverage hourly pay rose, but the average workweek for private-sector employees dipped 0.2 hour to 34.4 hours. That meant average weekly paychecks declined.\nBut over the past year, total pay after adjusting for inflation is up a healthy 2.1 percent, economists said. That increase should fuel consumer spending in coming months.\nThe job growth is occurring while the U.S. economy is growing modestly but steadily. It expanded at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the January-March quarter, fueled by the strongest consumer spending in two years.\nA strong recovery in housing is helping drive more hiring. Rising home sales and construction creates more jobs and spurs more spending on furniture, landscaping and other services.\nOne company that\u0027s benefited is SolarCity, based in San Mateo, Calif. Rising home building has helped increase demand for the solar-power systems the company installs in homes and businesses.\nCEO Lyndon Rive says SolarCity added 177 jobs in April and will welcome its 3,000th employee Monday. It\u0027s hiring engineers, installers and administrative support staff and still has 400 open jobs.\nConsumers have been spending more even though their take-home pay was shrunk this year by a Social Security tax increase. On top of that, the economy has been under pressure from across-the-board government spending cuts that began taking effect March 1. And some small and midsize companies are concerned about new requirements under the federal health care law.\nAmericans\u0027 confidence in the economy jumped last month, lifted by a brighter outlook for hiring and expectations for higher pay, according to the Conference Board, a research group. Consumers\u0027 confidence and steady spending point to a broader recovery in their financial health that\u0027s easing the impact of the tax increase and raising hopes for sustainable growth.\nHouseholds have shed debt. Gasoline has gotten cheaper. Stock market averages are hitting new records.\nAnd home values are up. Prices rose 9.3 percent in February compared with a year ago, the most in nearly seven years, according to the Standard \u0026 Poor\u0027s/Case-Shiller 20-city index.\nRising home values have helped restore household wealth. Still, prices nationwide remain about 30 percent below their peak during the housing bubble in 2006. They\u0027re back only to where they were in 2003.\nYet the global economy, by contrast, is slowing. The European Union warned Friday, for example, that the 17 countries that use the euro currency will shrink by a collective 0.4 percent this year. And unemployment across the eurozone is expected to hit an average of 12.2 percent. In Greece and Spain, it\u0027s forecast to reach 27 percent.\nBoth Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi have suggested that governments need to focus on stimulating growth and not just on spending cuts and deficit reduction.\nIn April, more Americans said they had part-time jobs even though they wanted full-time work. That figure rose 278,000 to 7.9 million, reversing a steep drop the previous month.\nSome economists worry that restaurants, retail chains and other companies are hiring more part-time workers in preparation for the implementation of health care reform. Companies with more than 50 full-time employees in 2013 will be required to provide health insurance to their full-time staff next year.\nMark Vitner, an economist at Wells Fargo, said restaurants have been adding jobs even though industry surveys suggest that sales haven\u0027t picked up much.\nThe revisions to the March and February figures were unusually large. Retailers, restaurants and hotels added 48,000 more jobs in February than previously reported. They accounted for three-quarters of that month\u0027s revision.\nThe government revises each month\u0027s job totals twice in the following two months. The revisions occur because many companies in the survey submit their responses late. Typically, about 75 percent of the 145,000 employers surveyed submit their responses in time for each month\u0027s initial report. The response rate usually rises to about 95 percent for the third and final estimate.\nThe number of people who have been unemployed for more than six months dropped 258,000 to 4.4 million. Over the past year, the number of long-term unemployed has declined by 687,000.\nA fire overnight at the Labor Department\u0027s headquarters shut down the building for most employees.

In April 2012, the jobless rate was 8.1 percent.\nThe better-than-expected data sparked a surge in US and European stocks, with the key New York indices smashing through to new records.\nThe S\u0026P 500 closed up 1.05 percent at 1,614.42, its first trip past 1,600, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average passed the 15,000 barrier for the first time, but slipped back, gaining 0.96 percent at 14,973.96.\nThe dollar spiked higher on the news but quickly reversed course, to trade lower at around $1.3118 per euro.\nAlan Krueger, chairman of the White House\u0027s Council of Economic Advisers, said the data showed the economy\u0027s continuing pull away from the 2008-2009 Great Recession.\nBut he warned that the push to further reduce government spending by Republicans in Congress could hurt growth.\n\"Now is not the time for Washington to impose self-inflicted wounds on the economy,\" he said in a statement.\n\"The administration continues to urge Congress to replace the sequester with balanced deficit reduction, while working to put in place measures to create middle-class jobs, such as by rebuilding our roads and bridges and promoting American manufacturing.\"\nThe Labor Department report sharply revised the overall picture of the economy more broadly from just one month ago, when analysts were shocked by the initial estimate of net jobs generated in March, a paltry 88,000.\nCoupled with other data, the March report had suggested a spring stall in the economy, the result of payroll tax increases that took effect in January and sequester spending cuts that started on March 1.\nThe big surprise in the report was the revision of the March jobs growth number to 138,000, as well as February\u0027s, which gained 64,000 to 332,000.\n\"The message is that last month\u0027s weaker-than-expected report was largely a false alarm,\" said Jim O\u0027Sullivan, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.\nAs over most of the past year, April\u0027s gains were all in the private sector, as government continued to shed jobs.\nJob creation was strongest in the professional and business services sector, tourism and entertainment, retail trade and health care, while industrial sector jobs shrank.\nStill, there were clear signs of ongoing weakness in the data.\nAverage hours worked per week in the private sector slipped to 34.4 from 34.6 in March, a possible sign of weakness in the economy, as was a 278,000 rise in the number of people forced to work part time, to 7.92 million.\nThe number of people counted as officially unemployed was little changed at 11.7 million.\nIn addition, the fall in jobs in the industrial sector, with manufacturing jobs flat, showed that efforts to rebuild US industry into a larger motor of the economy were sagging.\nOther data measures on Friday pointed to continued weakness: the ISM services purchasing managers index showed lower growth, and the Commerce Department said new orders for manufactured goods sank in March.\nDespite the strong job creation, summed up Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, the economy was still in a spring swoon.\n\"The full impact of the sequester cuts is yet to be felt and things will likely get softer before improving,\" he said.\n(AFP)\n","source":"google_52778141696863"}

The  nonresidential specialty trade contractor segment was hit hardest,  shedding 11,100 positions.

BLS unemployment rates  are not adjusted for seasonal variations.\nSimonson  says, “It is heartening to see that both nonresidential and residential  segments of the construction industry added significant numbers of  workers in the last 12 months, even though gains from March to April  were limited to the residential side.”\nAnother  bright signal is that architectural and engineering services, a separate  BLS category from construction, added 2,700 jobs in April.\nAnirban  Basu, Associated Builders and Contractors chief economist, says the  April BLS construction report “reinforces the notion that sustained  recovery remains elusive.” Construction\u0027s  April 13.2% unemployment rate is the highest among U.S. industries. It  also is the only industry to post a jobless rate higher than 10%.\nBut Basu  adds, “There are many projects in various stages of planning and the  expectation is that the nonresidential construction labor market will  strengthen later this year.”\nOver all,  BLS reported, the U.S. economy picked up 165,000 jobs in April, nudging  the unemployment rate down to 7.5% from March’s 7.6%.\nKeywords:\n","source":"google_52778141696863"}

Google is no exception, and after a hearty helping of rumors to that end, Google has filed a patent application that indicates that the company might have one of its own in development. (The patent title is pretty clear: \"Smart-watch with user interface features.”)\nThis Google smartwatch makes no clear mention of Bluetooth -type connectivity, which has been something of a hallmark for these devices, although it does detail all manner of wireless connectivity such as WAN, LAN, satellite (indicating perhaps GPS capabilities), “telecommunications” network (does that mean Dick Tracy-style voice or even video calls?), and so on.\nThe basic components of this smartwatch will be a wristband, a base, a battery, and at least one auxiliary component. The base will include most of the brains of the operation, such as the processor and a wireless transceiver, and the battery and wristband would be connected, with the wristband containing a voltage line.\nAdditionally, the wristband’s clasp could connect the circuit when the wearer dons the device, and it could also contain a USB plug or other connector. More impressively, the device could have two separate touchpads on the wristband, which would allow for pinch, stretch, and tap up/tap down functionality. The whole system would be modular, so either a manufacturer or a consumer could potentially customize their own device by adding or removing components.\nThe whole thing is very intriguing, and of course, Google could completely disrupt the fledgling smartwatch market with such a device. It also might be designed to work in conjunction with Google Glass , which would be a pleasant surprise.\n","source":"google_52778141553525"}

This could be the ideal wearable tech to those that don’t want to go around wearing those highly conspicuous spectacles. Due to the lack of imaging hardware apparent on this smartwatch you might even be allowed to wear it while you have a beer in the Seattle’s Cedar Point Cafe Bar .\nThe patent details a smartwatch with dual touchpad controls, located on the wristband, which will respond to the now familiar Google Glass style tapping, swiping and holding gestures. The patent also suggests pinching and zooming gestures will be supported while the touchpad component may be removable. It is thought that the watch glass display was probably designed and sized to be just right to display a Google Glass style app card. I think it’s clever of Google to use the watch strap as a touch control interface on a system with such a limited screen space as a wristwatch.\nGoogle smartwatch front\nThe patent goes on to list various options which may be included in the smartwatch design such as what wireless and communications abilities may be employed “the Internet, a wide area network, a local area network, a satellite network, a telecommunications network, a private network, and combinations of these”. Also interestingly, a design feature could optionally sleep the watch when it is removed from a user’s wrist. For making a wired connection, parts of the clasp mechanism may be used and made in the form of a USB port or plug.\nGoogle smartwatch strap with USB clasp\nThe brains behind the Google smartwatch plans are mainly supplied by Dr. Richard Gossweiler who VentureBeat describe as “an interaction design übernerd”.

According to GSM Insider , an AnTuTu benchmark for a device named Google X has been spotted.\nThe benchmark reveals that the device was tested in the US and is equipped with a 1.5GHz processor, which could either be the Snapdragon 600, 800 or the Tegra 4. The last major bit of information to be revealed in the benchmark is that the handset seems to run on Android 5.0.1. However, all of this information is subject to change as the phone is still ubder development, .\nThe Google X Phone benchmark reveals Android 5.0.1\n \nBack in March, it was rumoured that the handset will have a 4.8-inch display made of sapphire glass, which is said to be three times harder to crack than Corning\u0027s Gorilla Glass.\nThe corners of the smartphone will supposedly be made with rubber bumpers to make the phone sturdier, and the back will be carbon fibre. It is said to have a 4000 mAh battery, staying in line with Motorola’s affinity for high-capacity batteries. As an added bonus, the device will also supposedly be water-resistant. To be fair, these rumours sound too good to be true.\nIn the past, we\u0027ve heard rumours suggesting the phone will have an edge-to-edge full HD display , a rugged or unbreakable casing and a long-lasting battery, something that Google feels has often been ignored by other manufacturers. It is also said to feature the Sony Exmor RS sensor, which is used in the Sony Xperia Z.\nIt\u0027s rumoured that the X Phone will also give you the liberty to pick the device and then choose which carrier you want to go with. Similar to how Dell changed the PC game in the 1990s, Google wants to build phones to order and then sell them at a very affordable price tag, which won’t be bound to a contract.\nReportedly, the back of the X Phone is no ordinary panel—Google is said to have implemented a touch-sensitive button in the Motorola logo back there. Motorola had included a similar feature in its Backflip phone. This rumour is in line with a patent application from Google covering backside device touch controls. There’s no word on what exactly the rear touch panel\u0027s functions are, but it\u0027s rumoured it could be used to scroll through webpages and for launching voice commands.\nRumours suggest that the handset will be hitting the shelves by the end of the year.\n","source":"google_52778141553525"}

The unnamed source was said to have been briefed on the project.\nGoogle did not respond to a request for comment on the report.\nGoogle was awarded a patent in October of 2012 for a smartwatch design that includes a processor, a flip-up display, a tactile user interface, and a wireless transceiver that can connect to a wireless router.\nReports of Google\u0027s smartwatch development effort come amid swirling rumors that Samsung and Apple have similar projects underway.\n\"I think this is part of the building of the \u0027Internet of things,\u0027\" said Zeus Kerravala, an analyst with ZK Research. \"The more things that are connected, they more value they have to us.\"\nIn that light, Google Glass could work very well with a smartwatch.\nThe Glass technology enables users to take photos, shoot video, pull up maps, and share images and information on social networks from their glasses. A transparent interface over the right eye shows options, and the device can be manipulated using voice control, gestures and touch.\nAt the South by South West (SXSW) conference in Texas earlier this month, Google demonstrated how Glass can use apps like sending  and receiving email through the company\u0027s Gmail service.\nA Google smartwatch could deliver email or text messages, location and map information or even coupons for a store the user walking past. And the messages could be passed on to Glass, or messages sent to Glass passed on to the smartwatch.\nAnd in the idea of connectedness, a user\u0027s refrigerator could alert the watch or eye glasses that the user low on milk and eggs.\nJust yesterday, Google filed an application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to patent technology that enables Google Glass to control devices such as a garage door opener, a refrigerator with a control interface, a home alarm system or a copy machine.\n\"There would be a lot of commonality and synergy between [Glass and a smartwatch] in terms of both information and use,\" said Rob Enderle, an analyst with the Enderle Group. \"They could also be complimentary with the watch providing a better place to put certain kinds of sensors and to step in when the Glass product had to be removed.\"\n\"I think we are talking a family of products,\" he added. \"There clearly will be people who will prefer the watch approach over the glass approach and this would allow Google to better explore both options.\"\nSharon Gaudin covers the Internet and Web 2.0, emerging technologies, and desktop and laptop chips for Computerworld.

Matthew Luke owns shares of Luxottica Group. The Motley Fool ...","text":"By The Motley Fool in News\nPublished: April 7, 2013 at 1:37 pm\nLately it seems that every other day brings with it news about the emerging wearable technology space. A few days ago I wrote about  The Suddenly Crowded Smartwatch Space . In that article I talked about how the much hyped, but completely unconfirmed, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) iWatch product was being joined by the confirmed Samsung smartwatch and the unconfirmed Google Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG ) Android smartwatch.\nJust last week Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Baidu.com, Inc. (ADR) (NASDAQ: BIDU ), and Sony Corporation (ADR) (NYSE: SNE ) each join the fray, but this time in the smartglasses space made famous by Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) Glass.\nGoogle Glass First a little bit about Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) Glass. Officially unveiled last year, Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) Glass is the company’s effort to develop and offer augmented-reality smartglasses to the masses. Google Glass is essentially a wearable computer, with the lenses acting as the display monitor. Although the lenses will only be about 2-inches wide, it will appear much larger to the user. Large enough for the user to be able to vocally interact with Google various services; searching with Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) Search, navigating with Google Maps, video conferencing with Google+ Hangouts and sending and receiving text messages using Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) Now (just to name a few).\nAt least initially, Google Glass will not be a replacement for the smartphone, but a supplement to it. Lacking any cellphone connectivity of its own, the Google Glass smartglasses will be wirelessly paired to an Android or iOS device to provide all of the internet-connected functionality. What hardware the Google Glass does include is an integrated GPS chip, an embedded camera for taking still photos and 720p video recording, and bone-vibration audio ‘speakers’ (instead of traditional earbud speakers).\nGoogle Glass is presumed to have a release rate of Q4 2013 for the complete version, as well as a modular version to be used with a user’s existing prescription glasses soon after.\nThe Baidu Eye Originally thought to be an April Fools’ Day joke, a leaked image purportedly showed a Baidu.com, Inc. (ADR) (NASDAQ:BIDU) employee wearing a prototype smartglasses device. It was soon learned that the device was no joke, as it has now been confirmed by Chinese internet search giant as a real device under development. Codenamed the Baidu.com, Inc. (ADR) (NASDAQ:BIDU) Eye, from what little we know this device is similar to Google Glass in many regards.\nLike the Google Glass, the Baidu.com, Inc. (ADR) (NASDAQ:BIDU) Eye features a small heads-up display, voice recognition, and bone-vibration audio. Not much is known about the software side of the device, but initial reports indicated that Baidu.com, Inc. (ADR) (NASDAQ:BIDU) would use an open OS platform that could also be incorporated into other wearable tech devices. This leaves open the possibility for a potential Chinese competitor to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s unconfirmed iWatch device. Currently though, this device is just being internationally tested on a very small scale and is nowhere near as complete as the Google Glass project.\nMicrosoft’s “Me Too!” Device The latest smartglasses rumor comes to us by way of an analyst note last Thursday. In the note, the analyst communicated to investors that he believes Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) will release their Google Glass competitor in the first half of 2014. Not much is known beyond that. As rumors and speculations go, this one is fairly lacking. Although, considering Apple, Google, Samsung, and now Baidu.com, Inc. (ADR) (NASDAQ:BIDU) all have confirmed and unconfirmed (but likely) wearable tech projects under development, it is not surprising at all that Microsoft would also follow suit. If a Microsoft smartglasses device is to be released in the first half of 2014 (potentially just eight months away), we will know for sure in short order.\nSony’s Patent Pending A bit refreshing, this latest bit of news is not a rumor, leaked photo, or an analyst’s gut feeling. This is an actual detailed patent application Sony Corporation (ADR) (NYSE:SNE) filed on March 21 for a “head-mounted display apparatus.” This device differs from Google Glass in two main ways. Unlike Google Glass’ single display monitor placed in front of the eyeglass lens, the Sony patent application calls for a device with two display monitors placed behind each eyeglass lens. Also different is the traditional earbuds found on the frames on the Sony eyeglasses, rather than Google’s technology choice of bone-vibration audio.\nIt is important to note that technology companies file for patents all the time for pretty much any and everything. Simply filing a patent is no guarantee that a company has any plans to develop and commercialize said patent. Though this patent application is one of many smartglasses-related patents Sony has recently filed for. So perhaps the Japanese tech giant is indeed preparing its own Google Glass competitor. Only time will tell.\nThe Dark-Horse Luxottica Luxottica Group SpA (ADR) (NYSE: LUX ) is the world’s largest eyewear company. You may have never heard of this Italian company, but you have definitely heard of its many brands. These brands include Ray-Ban, Oakley, Vogue, LensCrafters, Sunglass Hut, Pearle Vision and EyeMed Vision Care (just to name a tiny few). Generally not known for its technological contributions, Luxottica has actually been involved in developing the technology for smartglasses optics for about 15 years, with many patents in the area.\nUnlike all of the previously mentioned companies however, Luxottica is actually the only one with a smartglasses product actually available to purchase right now. Released last October, Luxottica launched the Oakley Airwave ski goggles that features a built-in heads-up display, integrated GPS and smartphone connectivity to iPhone and Android devices.\nLuxottica is a rather interesting way to play the smartglasses space. Glasses are, in addition to being a medical device, essentially jewelry for the eyes. Glasses are a very personal item, displayed prominently on a person’s face for the entire world to see. While the Google Glass technology and services are great, the aesthetics of their smartglasses prototype leaves much to be desired. Known for designing, manufacturing, distributing, retailing and insuring eyewear, Luxottica certainly knows how to make and sell a stylish pair of glasses and would make a good partner for any of these aforementioned technology-centric companies.\nFoolish Bottom Line As I talked about last article, it is amazing how quickly things can change in this wearable technology space. In just a few short days, three potential Google Glass competitors entered the smartglasses space. By this time next week, we could be inundated with a dozen or so additional pieces of major news. I cannot wait! This is indeed an exciting time for the future of wearable technology.\nMatthew Luke owns shares of Luxottica Group. The Motley Fool recommends Apple, Baidu, and Google.

This is an actual detailed patent application Sony filed on March 21 for a “head-mounted display apparatus.” This device differs from Google Glass in two main ways.","text":"The Suddenly Crowded Smartglasses Space\nSunday - 4/7/2013,  6:07pm  ET\nLately it seems that every other day brings with it news about the emerging wearable technology space. A few days ago I wrote about The Suddenly Crowded Smartwatch Space . In that article I talked about how the much hyped, but completely unconfirmed, Apple iWatch product was being joined by the confirmed Samsung smartwatch and the unconfirmed Google Android smartwatch.\nJust last week Microsoft , Baidu.com , and Sony each join the fray, but this time in the smartglasses space made famous by Google Glass.\nGoogle Glass\nFirst a little bit about Google Glass. Officially unveiled last year, Google Glass is the company’s effort to develop and offer augmented-reality smartglasses to the masses. Google Glass is essentially a wearable computer, with the lenses acting as the display monitor. Although the lenses will only be about 2-inches wide, it will appear much larger to the user. Large enough for the user to be able to vocally interact with Google various services; searching with Google Search, navigating with Google Maps, video conferencing with Google+ Hangouts and sending and receiving text messages using Google Now (just to name a few).\nAt least initially, Google Glass will not be a replacement for the smartphone, but a supplement to it. Lacking any cellphone connectivity of its own, the Google Glass smartglasses will be wirelessly paired to an Android or iOS device to provide all of the internet-connected functionality. What hardware the Google Glass does include is an integrated GPS chip, an embedded camera for taking still photos and 720p video recording, and bone-vibration audio ‘speakers’ (instead of traditional earbud speakers).\nGoogle Glass is presumed to have a release rate of Q4 2013 for the complete version, as well as a modular version to be used with a user’s existing prescription glasses soon after.\nThe Baidu Eye\nOriginally thought to be an April Fools’ Day joke, a leaked image purportedly showed a Baidu.com employee wearing a prototype smartglasses device. It was soon learned that the device was no joke, as it has now been confirmed by Chinese internet search giant as a real device under development. Codenamed the Baidu Eye, from what little we know this device is similar to Google Glass in many regards.\nLike the Google Glass, the Baidu Eye features a small heads-up display, voice recognition, and bone-vibration audio. Not much is known about the software side of the device, but initial reports indicated that Baidu would use an open OS platform that could also be incorporated into other wearable tech devices. This leaves open the possibility for a potential Chinese competitor to Apple’s unconfirmed iWatch device. Currently though, this device is just being internationally tested on a very small scale and is nowhere near as complete as the Google Glass project.\nMicrosoft’s “Me Too!” Device\nThe latest smartglasses rumor comes to us by way of an analyst note last Thursday. In the note, the analyst communicated to investors that he believes Microsoft will release their Google Glass competitor in the first half of 2014. Not much is known beyond that. As rumors and speculations go, this one is fairly lacking. Although, considering Apple, Google, Samsung, and now Baidu all have confirmed and unconfirmed (but likely) wearable tech projects under development, it is not surprising at all that Microsoft would also follow suit. If a Microsoft smartglasses device is to be released in the first half of 2014 (potentially just eight months away), we will know for sure in short order.\nSony’s Patent Pending\nA bit refreshing, this latest bit of news is not a rumor, leaked photo, or an analyst’s gut feeling. This is an actual detailed patent application Sony filed on March 21 for a “head-mounted display apparatus.” This device differs from Google Glass in two main ways. Unlike Google Glass’ single display monitor placed in front of the eyeglass lens, the Sony patent application calls for a device with two display monitors placed behind each eyeglass lens. Also different is the traditional earbuds found on the frames on the Sony eyeglasses, rather than Google’s technology choice of bone-vibration audio.\nIt is important to note that technology companies file for patents all the time for pretty much any and everything. Simply filing a patent is no guarantee that a company has any plans to develop and commercialize said patent. Though this patent application is one of many smartglasses-related patents Sony has recently filed for. So perhaps the Japanese tech giant is indeed preparing its own Google Glass competitor. Only time will tell.\n","source":"google_52778141553525"}

A mere three days after Samsung\u0027s confirmation that they were developing a smartwatch, rumors have begun circulating about similar devices in the works from both Google and LG.\nAn unnamed source allegedly familiar with the inner workings of LG told the Korea Times that the company was currently working on two pieces of wearable mobile technology: a smartwatch and a device similar to Google Glass. Though it remains to be seen if the devices will utilize an Android or Firefox operating system, the source hinted that both were being considered.\nRegarding the watch, the source said, \"It is one major part of many currently non-commercialized products under development by LG Electronics. The company has spared no efforts to invest in products that it believes are must-haves to stay ahead technology wise in the market, whatever the situation may be.\"\nSoon, you\u0027ll be able to look as cool as Dick Tracy.\nWhereas Google Glass was being developed by the company\u0027s high-concept X-Lab, the Financial Times is reporting that their smartwatch is being handled by the Android unit, which would imply that they\u0027re interested in rolling out the new device sooner rather than later. A 2011 patent application specified a smartwatch with a dual-screen flip display, a touchscreen, and a camera. The patent refers to the importance of wearability and convenience:\nA variety of portable user devices provide wireless network connectivity. Various features of a device often require a user to access the device at inconvenient times to perform a desired function. As a result, a user may simply not employ the device to its full capabilities.\nThe news comes hot on the heels of Samsung\u0027s and Apple\u0027s developments and the timing is surely not coincidental. With the recently released Pebble watch living up to the hype surrounding its record-breaking Kickstarter campaign, smartwatches are evidently here to stay.\nMelissa Grey is a lover of all things cats, comics, and outer space.

The claims are made based on a Google patent application for a dual display smart watch that was filed in 2011 and granted in 2012. Google has shown a strong interest in wearable, connected, electronic devices such as the Google Glass project, making it seem destined to join Apple and Samsung in the race to capture the nascent wearable devices market.\nThe Google smart watch patent application describes a dual display smart watch incorporating two touchscreen displays, with one flipping up to reveal a second display underneath it. The top display is partly transparent and would help to control the information displayed on the second display. The top display would show notifications, while the second display would show the complete contents of a given notification, like an email, for example. The smart watch also includes a camera that would also be activated when the flip top portion is in the open position hinting at face-to-face call possibilities.\nIt would certainly be an intriguing device if Google did go ahead and produce it, althought it has always been the case that patent applications do no necessarily lead to the development of actual shipping products. However, with stock analysts keen to see companies demonstrate growth potential, all of the key tech players are constantly searching for the next growth market. A smart watch may offer wider consumer appeal than a device like Google Glass that may also be cost prohibitive by comparison.\nBy Electronista Staff\n","source":"google_52778141553525"}

He has spent over 25 years working with numerous Fortune 500 corporations with respect to assisting them in the creation of new user experiences. He is also a founder of the design studio MONKEYmedia, which recently launched a patent infringement lawsuit against Apple that we will discuss in Part II of the interview. MONKEYmedia also has litigation pending against Sony, Disney and others. And on top of all of this, Bear is a testifying expert witness for patent infringement cases . Simply, there is little in the software/patent space that Bear hasn’t seen or been a part of over his career.\nIn Part I of our conversation, which appears below, we discuss the journey from ideas to designs that sit in the path of disruptive technology and could realistically be useful 5, 10 or more years down the road.\nWithout further ado, my conversation with software expert and prolific inventor Eric Gould Bear.\nQUINN: Thanks for taking the time to chat. As an inventor and an expert witness and as an all-around knowledgeable software guru, I imagine you probably have some thoughts on addressing the issues one faces when you first have an idea, that “ah, ha” moment. How do you get over the humps to put what you have into some kind of tangible form? That is something that a lot of people in new businesses seem to really struggle with.\nBEAR: Are you asking me about the design and development side or what somebody, who’s already in the business of design and development, should do to make sure they keep a parallel track of IP protection?\nQUINN: I’d like to talk to you about both. Let’s start with the first – as to how you get your arms around what is going to wind up being, at the end of the day, a monstrous task that starts with a design document.\nBEAR: It’s important to remember that ideas are a dime a dozen. And what matters at the end of the day, in my mind, is what works well for people. It comes down to making sure that your flash of genius is a fit for what’s valuable to real people in everyday life. Whether in a consumer space or in business, it doesn’t matter. The underlying principles of making great design come down to how people act in the world. How do they think about themselves? What do they feel about your product? What do they think about each other? And where are they running into challenges in either accomplishing things or living life to its fullest. So, if it starts with an idea, I would challenge that premise to begin with – because I believe great design often starts with a question as opposed to an answer.\nQUINN: Interesting. Let me stop you there for a second because that wasn’t where I thought you might end up going with this. This sounds like the way you would approach any kind of generic invention. I have a patent attorney friend who tells people, for example, that – and this is mostly with gadget inventions or tangible inventions – “if you don’t have five friends right now who would be willing to pay hard money for this then what are you doing? Stop.”\nBEAR: Yes!\nQUINN: And that seems to be where you might be heading, and I’d like to hear your thoughts on that. Then, let’s definitely circle back to start with the question, rather than the answer, idea or even the payoff.\nBEAR: Certainly. I’ve worked with companies of all sizes – from nascent startups to Fortune 500 companies. Sometimes they have an existing product, sometimes they don’t. But they usually do have thoughts about where they want things to go. And then there are R\u0026D programs, some of which I fund myself. In all cases, really, the question should be, “where is there going to be value for people?” I like to see projects start out with what we, in the user interface design field, call generative user research or generative design research.\nThis involves going out and looking at people in their everyday lives – whether in their workspace, in their car, walking down the street, in the living room, in the kitchen, at their desk – and watching them accomplish tasks or trying to make it through a communication or a media interaction. Wherever the demand is, watch how they do it. All kinds of things come up when you watch what people do in everyday life. It becomes quite obvious where the stumbling blocks are. It doesn’t mean that there are answers yet, but you start to see where the challenges lie. And if you look at enough people, then certain patterns and affinities reveal themselves to the design team about what might be needed.\nSo you take those findings from the user research and mix in the business goals. What does the business need to get out of it? Then, what are the marketing possibilities for how something like that could be sold? And then look at what’s technically feasible, given a particular window of time for getting the new product or service delivered. It might be that the solution is a fabulous answer to a discovered problem, but technically can’t be pulled off in the next eighteen months. It may be more of a framework for five years out. The art is finding an appropriate balance between those variables and making sure the right stakeholders from all of those different disciplines of the business are bought into addressing a common set of user needs. And until that’s done, it doesn’t really matter what the technology is – because there’s no tree to bark up just yet.\nQUINN: Well, this strikes me as the revelation that Thomas Edison came to very early on as he made those wonderful, great inventions. Nobody bought them because they’re just – they were cool and they were revolutionary and they were interesting – but they were not in demand. He is famously quoted as having said that he was never going to invent again in an area where there was not consumer demand. And that seems to be what you’re talking about right here, right now. Get in touch with how consumers use these things, what do they need and what if anything can you realistically provide.\nBEAR: That’s right. And there are two parallel tracks, at least, to be looking at. One is what can be reasonably built in a short period of time – well, short is relative to different businesses. The other involves delivering the best long-term model. Many businesses are handicapped because they’re looking at short-term P\u0026L to drive decisions. I think we’re all better off when we take the long view and then step back and say, “That’s where we want to be in ten years.” Then look backwards from the future and ask, “How did we get here?” Split that distance, then split that distance again, and split it again.\nThat can give you a roadmap for how to start building things that make a difference in the world. Even if you’re not the one who eventually builds it, by planning for that sort of future you can end up with a market leader in the short run and – perhaps more importantly to your audience – end up with some IP that’s in the path of other people’s disruptive inventions ten years in the future.\nThat seems, to me, the magic bullet. Ship something soon that is not the end all product, but get a batch of interrelated patent applications into the pipeline that in ten years may be super valuable. Then reap the benefits of that investment for the final ten years.\nQUINN: It takes so long to get these kinds of patents issued, that if what you’re doing doesn’t have a longer term goal in mind when you’re starting down that path, I wonder whether you really ought to be going down that path. Do you have thoughts on that?\nBEAR: I think you’re absolutely right. A lot of people are shortsighted. There’s this idea that someone’s come up with; and they want to build it; and it’s this thing that they’re emotionally attached to; and that’s the exact thing they’re trying to patent. Seems bananas, because by the time it issues the company’s played leapfrog on itself, and that myopic patent is old news.\nSince I’ve been working in invention and design and IP management together, I think of these disciplines in an integrated manner. But maybe for designers who are not thinking that way, there’s an opportunity for prosecution counsel to educate their clients in how to think about the longer term. I used to consider – when I first started filing patent applications on my work in 1992 – that the process of detailing a patent specification and writing claims was the opposite of design. Design is about converging on an optimal solution. Writing patents seemed backwards because it wasn’t necessarily about what was going to work well for people. Instead, it was about casting the widest net possible so that any solution in the vicinity of an ideal design would get caught.\nToday, twenty years later, I’ve found a more productive way of thinking about it. Now, I approach IP in an integrated manner – with long-term and short-term views that are working together. There’s a great opportunity for patent prosecution counsel and designers to be in partnership – thinking about how to do that and how to identify the disruptive technology umbrella, if you will. Where do you cast that initial set of claims and draft the appropriate specifications to support a claim base that can grow over time – even if outside the range of the initial solution – in an intelligent manner.\nQUINN: That’s what I always try and do with my clients. Well, my clients all do it because I suppose on some level when you’re picking patent counsel if their philosophy and approach is not something you’re comfortable with you find somebody else and go in a different direction. For the clients that I have, we do a patent search first. Not only to find out what’s out there in terms of how we’re going to distinguish over those things that are known, but to really try and identify where the open space is and where the boundaries may be and to get a sense of how big the open space is and where can this thing potentially grow.\nThen, once we have an idea that the core uniqueness described could support some patent claims, I tell them the fun stuff starts now. The fun starts because you want to then and think about this from a standpoint that assumes bandwidth is no issue and money is no object. What do you want in version next, in version three times next to wind up being? If you can describe it we can protect it. Of course, you can’t just to say, “I want to produce a holodeck.” Yeah, that’s great. Well, how are you gonna pull that one off? But if you can articulate the vision and a path there we can include it in a software patent application even if it won’t be incorporated until later versions.\nBEAR: Right.\nQUINN: With software, if you can dream it you can do it and at least describe it – and the limiting factor is bandwidth and money. So if you can get to a point, I always tell people, where you have this core uniqueness and then dream, now we’re starting to go down a path where you potentially would have something that could be relevant five to ten years down the road.\nBEAR: Codifying that dream is part of what we call user experience strategy. And it includes defining the pillars of that experience and the bounds for how it gets framed for end users through an evolution of business processes and technologies of the times. And, you know, it makes a lot of sense to lay that out first and then use it to write the patents. I think the trick is being able to put one’s self forward ten years, and then picture yourself sitting in a Markman Hearing and having your claims being interpreted against a new technology landscape. Take something that might have been designed yesterday for a desktop screen with a mouse and a keyboard and then translate to a touchscreen on a tablet, to then tactile, voice and gestural kinesthetic interfaces – another step farther.\nFor example, MONKEYmedia has a new family of patent applications that I co-authored last summer about navigating through a three-dimensional video space on a handheld device. But if you look forward ten years, it’s likely that the navigation will not be bound to a surface you’re holding in your hand and the system could be more like Google Glass or a Microsoft Kinect type interface for navigating. So everything needs to be written in such a way that it can scale beyond the technology that we immediately know. Consider how to map it so that at least one of the claims can apply to a new form factor, without being shut down. You don’t want them so broad that they’re killed with prior art. And you don’t want so narrow that they’ll become obsolete by the time they issue and not be infringed.\nQUINN: Right. That’s the big thing if you have a patent that’s going to wind up being useful beyond the relevant software life of the product you envision currently. It has to be able to be breathable. It has to grow and it has to relate. So how do you get from conception to span your head around where the marketplace is likely heading?\nBEAR: Well, it’s very difficult. And it may sound crazy to you, but a great place to go to look at where things could go is science fiction. Not necessarily literally, and not to say those inventions are going to be what comes out, but science fiction establishes the bar in people’s minds for what the future could be. And, in a way, it shapes how we designers and engineers think about what we’d want to make ourselves. In reality, creativity is informed by the things that we see around us; and science fiction is a lot of what we see. So it’s a pretty good predictor of the kind of things that will end up being made. If you can imagine, take your favorite science fiction film – whether it’s Minority Report, which was a great herald of the kind of gestural interactions that we’re developing today, or Star Trek – and identify the best user experiences. Ok, now ask yourself, “How would my invention work in the 23rd century?” And then, probably in reality, it’s going to be more like ten or fifteen years. Be ready for that!\nQUINN: I’m a Star Trek fan and I totally agree with what you say because I think science fiction really does inspire the next generation of creative minds, the engineers and designers that ask “what if?” and pursue some rather interesting paths. There’s now research into teleporting atoms or molecules and the patent office last year issued the world’s first cloaking patent.\nPREVIEW: In Part II we will discuss defining a software innovation so that it can withstand judicial scrutiny many years after the fact.

Photograph: Annie Collinge for the Observer\nOne evening in October of last year, after a reported couple of drinks in a Brooklyn bar, Rupert Murdoch was giving a good impression of a man who thought he had seen the future. From his car on the way home he tweeted: \"Who\u0027s heard of VICE media? Wild, interesting effort to interest millennials who don\u0027t read or watch established media. Global success.\"\nThe months since have served to emphasise the Digger\u0027s clairvoyance. If you hadn\u0027t heard of Vice media back then, it is likely that now you have. In America, in particular, two archly millennial Vice stories have made the \"established media\", Murdoch included, look distinctly 20th-century by comparison. The first involved the on-the-run internet millionaire, John McAfee , whose paranoid tale of drugs, murder and subterfuge in the jungly paradise of Belize dominated the daily news channels and blog sites for a few weeks before Christmas. When McAfee surfaced, having gone into hiding after being sought for questioning over the death of his neighbour, it was in the company of not only his 18-year-old girlfriend, but also a couple of young reporters from Vice. While the rest of the world\u0027s media, as well as the Belize police force, had tried to track McAfee down, Vice had helped to smuggle the fugitive over the border into Guatemala, and also, in true chaotic gonzo fashion, succeeded in inadvertently revealing his whereabouts in a blogged photo, which carried the message, \" We are with John McAfee right now, suckers! \"\nThe second Vice scoop was perhaps even more incendiary. Last month a documentary film crew from Vice blagged its way into North Korea in the company of the NBA legend, and celebrity rehab casualty, Dennis Rodman, and the Harlem Globetrotters. The Vice crew once again could hardly believe its fortune when Rodman ended up befriending Kim Jong-Un , the recently installed supreme leader of the world\u0027s most repressive regime, and now, apparently a basketball fan. Over the course of a couple of days, outtakes from this unlikely bromance were sent from the Hermit Kingdom via Vice.com and provoked predictably manic viral attention.\nWhen I visit Vice\u0027s offices in Brooklyn, co-founder Shane Smith has spent the weekend both defending Rodman\u0027s \"basketball diplomacy\" and revelling in the media storm that has attended it. The story, a trademark mix of laddish farce and harder-edged foreign affairs is, he suggests, pretty much the perfect Vice exclusive. \"The thing is: Dennis Rodman is absurd. North Korea is absurd. And our whole mission statement at Vice is the absurdity of the modern condition. So it made perfect sense for us.\" Smith is amused and frustrated in about equal measure by the generally outraged response of Fox and CNN and the New York Times and the rest. Above all it demonstrated, he says, a certain kind of unease â€“ perhaps even envy â€“ at the Vice philosophy of what he calls \"immersive\" journalism.\nHow much, I wonder, did Rodman, the lavishly pierced and tattoed former lover of Madonna, know about the trip in advance?\n\"Well I think he was keen to go play a game with the kids there but I don\u0027t suppose he quite got the gravity of what he was doing and where he was going. He\u0027s not a diplomat. And frankly we did not know that Kim Jong-Un would show up. When he did, we thought: \u0027Oh, OK, what happens now?\u0027 And then, when he said, \u0027Hey, everyone come back to my place for dinner!\u0027 we were quite gobsmacked.\"\nIn some ways it was a logical conclusion to what has been a long-term obsession for Smith. He visited the police state a couple of times in 2007 to film The Vice Guide to North Korea , a documentary of pre-conceived weirdness which did not stray far from what heavy-handed minders allowed. Smith was, in any case, subsequently banned from returning, but felt he had unfinished business in Pyongyang. He believes the Rodman stunt served a wider purpose, giving his film crew \"unparalleled access\" to the regime for a documentary on which they are still working.\n\"People turned round and said we ate food with this guy [Kim Jong-Un] and people are starving in North Korea. So you are saying no diplomat can ever eat food with a bad leader? That\u0027s half the world gone. It\u0027s just we had an idea of how to get in and how to get access and it worked. But when people like [former Clinton spokesman, now a TV political journalist] George Stephanopoulos ask Dennis Rodman about foreign policy and people are surprised he doesn\u0027t understand all the subtlety, I mean who is shocked by that?\"\nThe Vice Guide to North Korea\nIs it journalism in any sense, though, or just a curious, contrived spectacle? \"Well,\" he says, \"we are getting a story that everyone is interested in seeing and nobody else could get. People call us \u0027adventure journalists\u0027 or \u0027daredevil journalists\u0027 or whatever. But in an insane world the mad way often works â€¦\"\nSmith has high hopes that the Rodman documentary will surpass the million-plus hits reached by Vice\u0027s 2009 interview, by Smith himself, with Joshua Blahyi, known as General Butt Naked, the cannibal warlord of Liberia . \"Both are crazy stories with sad and tragic underpinnings,\" he says. \"But a news story for us is the same as for everyone; we like our stories to punch you in the face.\"\nDoes he ever feel that he weights his stories more to the punch in the face, and less to the sad and tragic underpinnings?\n\"The easy answer is no. If you look at the story we did about the slave labour camps of Liberia,\" he says, [another strand of the Vice Guide to Liberia] \"we broke the story, it was an important story. This guy General Butt Naked killed 20,000 people and ate some of them. I don\u0027t know how you would go about further sensationalising those facts.\"\nShane Smith is a burly 42-year-old Canadian, whose vast glass-sided office is dominated at one end by a stuffed grizzly bear in front of a blown-up photo of the snow-capped Rockies. He is a direct and charming talker, but he carries just the vaguest hint that if there were any literal punching in the face to be done, he would not be taking a step back. The Vice offices are in a corner of recently gentrified Williamsburg , on a street decorated with expensively commissioned graffiti and bookended by slightly contrived boho cafes. The office itself is on the site of a former brewery, but any sense that this is a sort of slacker\u0027s paradise is dispelled when you step inside, and teams of intense twentysomethings are busily convening everywhere you look to discuss this magazine spread, or that mobile platform, or the latest YouTube offering or marketing collaboration.\nVice has come an awful long way from its origins as a free and underground music magazine in Smith\u0027s native Montreal 20 years ago. He created it with a couple of friends â€“ having persuaded the city fathers to let them take over an earnest community title called the Voice. In the two decades since Vice dropped its middle \"o\" it has grown from being a \"hipsters\u0027 bible\", given away on street corners and in record stores, to a global brand with offices in 34 countries. The high-traffic online and documentary film incarnations of the Vice sensibility are about to spawn a 24-hour terrestrial news channel available in 18 countries. A documentary series in partnership with august HBO will include the Rodman and McAfee films. There is also a record label and an ad agency, Virtue, which numbers Nike and Dell among its clients. Announcing some of those departures at an industry event in Abu Dhabi last year, Smith envisioned \"a changing of the guard within the media,\" and announced his ambition for Vice to become both the largest online media network in the world and \"the voice of the angry youth\".\nTo back up this fighting talk, Spike Jonze, the disruptive intelligence behind the film Being John Malkovich and the Jackass franchise, was installed in 2007 as creative director. Two years ago a consortium that included Sir Martin Sorrell\u0027s WPP advertising group, and Tom Freston, founder of MTV, invested a reported $50m in Vice media. Since the company purchased Vice.com (formerly a porn site) the same year, revenues have doubled to a reported $200m in 2012, on which insiders suggest an unverified 20 per cent profit margin. Smith talks of 3,000 contributors, though the official payroll is about 850. The average age of a Vice journalist is 25, but scanning the screen-staring ranks of the magazine\u0027s newsroom that seems on the high side. It is easy to see why, on his visit here, Rupert Murdoch might suddenly have felt all of his 82 years.\nSmith retains a centralised control of his ever-shoutier multi-platform mouthpiece. \"We have a global editor, then we have domestic editors and content directors each country that we are in,\" he says. \"They send in the stories they want to do and we say \u0027great, let\u0027s do it\u0027, or \u0027no, let\u0027s not do it\u0027. And we make a call that this would be good for online, this would be good for mobile, this would be good for the mag, this would be good for TV and so on.\"\nHe remains insistently involved with every stage of that decision-making. \"We are releasing so much content now,\" he says, \"that there is a probability otherwise that it will run away with itself. You know, if you are Henry Ford you better give a shit about making cars. And if you are making grapple grommets you better give a shit about grapple grommets. We are in the business of creating content so I better give a shit about that.\"\nGeneral Butt Naked, the cannibal warlord of Liberia\nBefore meeting Smith I\u0027ve been trying to get a proper immersive sense of what that content might include. There is above all a sort of attention-deficit quality to Vice\u0027s output, shifting abruptly between tones and sensibilities. To take just the current magazine for example, lengthy closely reported articles about expat Jewish Americans settling illegally on the West Bank and the rise of Swedish fascism rub up against vaguely cruel spreads about Elvis lookalikes and high-concept fashion shoots. There is a voyeuristic Dazed and Confused edge to a lot of it, done with the production values of National Geographic, and occasionally the kind of easy misogyny that has seen the magazine banned from campuses (though Smith insists that the readership, particularly online, \"is not skewed as much to the male as you might think â€“ no more than 60 per cent\"). Regular features include \"Do\u0027s and Don\u0027ts\" which offers a surrealist commentary on random snapshots of people, fashion victims and other candidly photographed unfortunates, in the street or in clubs or bars, sometimes bleakly funny, sometimes laced with the kind of bullying rhetoric of anonymous blogging. Alongside that there is an indefatigable effort to find a musement in the world â€“ there have been popular \"Vice Guides\" to everything from anal sex to Mecca â€“ and a commitment to understanding, however brutally, or surreally, the margins of global culture. The writing owes something to the golden age of British style and music magazines , the Face and NME and the rest, self-consciously erudite or smugly postmodern, and something to the packaged curiosity, and patient storytelling, of Reader\u0027s Digest.\nSmith and his less visible co-founder Suroosh Alvi have the unusual ability both to curate this slightly dysfunctional mix and sell it smoothly to advertisers and anyone else who might listen. He gestures intermittently toward his and the magazine\u0027s \"DIY punk origins\", but you guess he was always more Malcolm McLaren than Johnny Rotten. \"We were a quintessential Gen X magazine, and we are now a quintessential Gen Y company,\" he will say.\nHow does he define that particular alphabetical shift? I wonder.\n\"Well,\" he says, \"20 years ago we were the hipsters\u0027 bible and all that crap, and then we went online, and famously, or famously at least in Vice lore, we reinvented ourselves. We like to say, in reference to Dylan, \u0027We are not afraid to go electric\u0027. We let our very high-profile editors go. We handed the thing over to kids straight out of school and let them run our magazine. And that has allowed us to become this Gen Y platform. It took us 10 years to get to a million copies of the magazine, and it took us one year to get to 10m uniques [online browsers] a month.\"\nAnd how does he measure success himself?\n\"For me personally, you always think when you are starting out, I am going to make a nebulous amount of money, buy an island, wear an Amadeus wig and go naked and be crazy. But, you know, I was talking recently to Spike [Jonze] and he said \u0027Take money out of the equation. And ask yourself what would you do?\u0027 and I realised two things: first I would pay money to do the job I am doing, and second I wanted to build the next CNN, the next ESPN. And I also realised that given the digital revolution that is not only within my grasp, but I am frontrunner to get there. Once I realised money isn\u0027t the report card, and putting your imprint on the world\u0027s cultural fabric is possible, that is when we stopped scrabbling around on the periphery begging for money, and thought \u0027let\u0027s go for it\u0027.\"\nIt may not sound much of a business plan, but the money duly followed \"in buckets\". It\u0027s in Smith\u0027s interest to say so, but you pretty much believe him when he suggests that every private equity firm or media corporation around has tried to buy Vice at one time or another. Rupert Murdoch was only the latest mogul enthusiast for the company, he suggests.\n\"We have had everyone in here. Hearst, Time, CondÃ©, Google. It was funny, we were in a meeting with News Corp and Rupert walked in, and I said, \u0027You should come by the office some time, check out the shop\u0027. And he said, \u0027Well let\u0027s go now\u0027. So we drove out here and I walked him round, we had a drink in a bar round the corner. And I suppose because he is recognisable people started tweetingâ€¦\"\nSmith explains Murdoch\u0027s fascination with Vice as only natural. He has the feeling that in the \"boardrooms of every major media company they are saying, \u0027OK we need Gen Y, we need online, we need social, we need mobile, and we don\u0027t have any of that stuff. We need it globally, we need scale and we need to be able to monetise all that.\u0027 So they look around to see who ticks those boxes and eventually they come to us. They come out here and see all the kids working 18 hours a day and everyone really passionate. They think, \u0027Yes, we have cracked the internet code!\u0027 And they are so used to everyone saying yes, to people who have been waiting for their Amadeus wig all these years, that when we say actually we are not really interested in selling, they keep offering us more millions.\"\nSmith developed some of his business acumen in his gap year after studying political science at Carleton University in Ottawa, when he apparently set himself up as a black-market currency trader in Budapest at the time of the fall of Soviet communism. For a while he says, he was earning more in a day than doctors there earned in a week. That kind of thing. Having been \"a real leftist, working for Greenpeace and all that\" he consequently developed something of a taste for edgy capitalism. Even so, when he returned to Montreal and started the magazine, he couldn\u0027t understand how anyone could buy a car, or why you would want a mortgage. \"But once you have a family and kids you realise the importance of those things.\"\nSmith has two daughters, now, aged three and one. I wonder, eyeing the grizzly bear at his shoulder, if fatherhood has put him more in touch with his feminine side?\n\"It is funny,\" he says, \"I was in Libya with a bunch of mujahideen jihadists doing a story when I heard that my second baby would also be a girl, and when I told them they were all so thrilled, \u0027Allah has blessed you!\u0027 And I said I thought it was kind of interesting in such a male-dominated culture for them to be so excited that it was to be a daughter. They said \"No! A man needs daughters, they will love you forever and never leave you, unlike sons who are off at the first opportunity.\"\nSmith himself is a case in point in that regard. Though he talks about a very happy childhood, he also claims to have left home and got himself a job and a place to live aged 13 â€“ \"I was in a bit of a gang, a headstrong guy\". Not for the first time, in talking to him, I have the sudden sense that his father, a pioneer computer programmer amongst other things, might have been something of a tough taskmaster.\nHe laughs when I suggest that. \"He was. My dad has always been like me but on steroids, a lot smarter than I am, a lot tougher than I am, sort of a George Bernard Shaw: taught himself everything. But the thing was he was never happy. It\u0027s my luck that I am that much stupider than him. When I graduated, I had a paper published in this political journal and everyone was so proud, and I remember coming home and he just destroyed my thesis. He knew more about it than I did even though I had been studying the subject for years. And he wasn\u0027t trying to knock me down, he just knew a lot about everything, theoretical physics, whatever, but he could never get it across. I my case I kind of lobotomised myself with booze and drugs early on but the one thing I had, I could sell ideas.\"\nStill, Smith suggests, he can hear his father\u0027s voice in his head, when things have been tough, when the magazine was failing to begin with, or when he has tried to launch in new cities. \"When I was a kid my dad told me two things,\" he says. \"Life isn\u0027t fair and you have to be both the strongest guy and the smartest guy. He thought it was important that I could build a house from scratch, so I worked alongside him as he built one. From when I was eight years old we would go and get a car from the junkyard and work out how to get it running. That was the weekend.\"\nGiven he was forced to grow up early, it\u0027s understandable perhaps that the dominant sensibility of Smith\u0027s creation should have been a kind of permanent adolescence. He recently had the idea for a TV series about the generally parlous state of the world, and the mostly juvenile political response to fixing it, entitled \"Where are all the adults?\" Then he realised that perhaps he had the opportunity to be a grown-up himself. With this in mind he seems to visualise a future in which Vice comes of age with him, and becomes the voice of a more politicised generation, the one just now realising that it has been shut out from the opportunities enjoyed by those who have gone before.\n\"In the beginning,\" he suggests, in biblical fashion, of the first web generation, \"there was this era online of let\u0027s just be cool and criticise everything, and we were very guilty of that. But as Josey Wales says, \u0027There comes a point when it is time to get busy living or it is time to get busy dying.\u0027 So we have been trying to say, OK we are going to go out and actually do stuff, get involved. We don\u0027t mind if people hate us, we would prefer them to love us, but we don\u0027t want indifference.\"\nWhat kind of stuff will they do, though, beyond Rodman-style stunts? It is Smith\u0027s and therefore Vice\u0027s contention that we are approaching a kind of reckoning. The stories he is drawn to tend to have a red-in-tooth-and-claw apocalyptic component, whether he is documenting a two-week traffic jam in Mongolia, or featuring, as the current online offering does, the sewage flooded graveyards of Gaza, or describing what happens when you wear semen-scented perfume for a week. If you read only Vice, I\u0027m pretty sure paranoia, possibly agoraphobia, would set in quite quickly.\nThis brand of stylised bleakness is evidence, he suggests, that \"the cheque has now arrived â€“ economically, geopolitically, environmentally â€“ and the coming generation, Gen Y, are realising they are going to have to pay it. Would I like Vice to be a major part of the media that reflects that? Absolutely. If you look not just at the Arab spring, but at what I call the youth spring that has started in Europe, young people are starting to find a voice, and they are not looking to the traditional media to reflect that. CNN was made by the Gulf war. I think the economic crisis will prove to be our Gulf war. It is making young people very angry and we want to be the voice of that anger.\"\nHis commitment to the absurdity of the modern condition is one part of that rage, he says. \"A lot of what happens in the world is full-on crazy and doesn\u0027t get reported on. We want to change that.\" He doesn\u0027t believe that the outsider generation Vice is speaking to will adopt old-style party-based politics any time soon, but will assume instead a far more eclectic and scattershot range of anger and passion. \"Going forward it\u0027s clear that advocacy will be a hugely powerful force. If you dislike what General Motors is doing, you can overnight create a movement to tell people to buy Ford. What we want to do is provide more and more information to this generation to help them to bring that kind of advocacy.\"\nSmith is clearly a man who warms to themes. Having started him on this line of thinking, he quickly gets into his stride, lecturing me now on the complacency of the western world, now on Vice\u0027s crucial role as agit-proppers-in-chief.\n\"In the early days it was kicking against the pricks,\" he says, at one point. \"If we had received the press that we have gotten over this North Korea thing in the early days we would have all been walking up Broadway with our middle fingers in the air. We are not afraid to fight our corner, but we have a documentary team there still, we have a job to do. If that is growing up, then yes, we are growing up.\"\nSmith routinely reserves the full blast of his frustration for the media status quo, the commentators and the columnists who don\u0027t set foot out of the door of their office and blithely assume that the world is pretty much as it always was. He can quickly rouse himself to the full rhetorical anger of the midnight blogger, while all the time carefully positioning his business as both the authentic voice of the outsider, and the new mainstream.\n\"American media has just become talk radio, incredibly partisan name-calling and op-eds,\" he says. \"I think the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan proved it has completely failed to act as an effective fourth estate. And young people didn\u0027t sleep through that, as is widely believed, they learned instead not to trust what they were being told. Huffington Post and Drudge Report and all these things came up, exactly because people no longer had any faith in the traditional media. I am not saying either of those things are great, but they are a symptom of that loss of trust. I am not even saying Vice is great. I always say: if Vice has become a primary news source, then the world is completely fucked! I mean, we are still talking half the time about rare denim and sneakers!\n\"But the fact is four corporations own all of American news, and they are all equally scared of losing Budweiser or whoever as their advertisers. The greatest propaganda coup of the American right has been to convince its citizens that we are in the grip of a liberal conspiracy. As a result, Obama is to the right of Richard Nixon on most issues. And there is we believe, certainly some space to exploit there.\" He pauses, smiles, concludes his lesson for the day. \"And we, Vice, aim to exploit it.\"\nThis article was amended on 25/03/13 to clarify the starting point of Spike Jonze\u0027s involvement with Vice.\n","source":"google_52778141553525"}

So why can’t Congress help them?\nUpdated: January 30, 2013 |  9:05 a.m.\nMarch 15, 2012 |  4:00 p.m.\nThe Class Dojo team, from left, Sam Chaudhary, Kalen Gallagher, Monica Harvancik, and Liam Don work in their office, located in a one-bedroom Palo Alto, Calif., apartment. (Max Whittaker/Prime)\nPALO ALTO, Calif.—Sam Chaudhary sleeps on the couch in the boxy one-bedroom apartment, Liam Don on a mattress on the floor. Most of the place, such as it is—and it isn’t much, frankly—has been turned over to a business. Or, at the very least, the dream of one. There are five desks with five chairs, separated from the modest kitchen by a tall dry-erase board. The handwritten sign hangs in the window and reads “ClassDojo.” The rest of the beige-on-beige complex, it seems, is all single mothers and kids cruising on pastel-painted bikes.\nIn an earlier era, this drab stack of living spaces could be called a tenement, a place where recent arrivals pooling their meager resources would dwell as they started new lives in America. But Chaudhary and Don aren’t traditional immigrants. And they have no hard-luck story of ocean odysseys or coyote-bribing to tell. Natives of Great Britain both, Chaudhary walked away from a lucrative business-consulting career, and Don took leave of a doctoral program in computer science. On two weeks’ notice, they left parents and girlfriends and comfortable lives in London for a Northern California outpost more than 5,000 miles from home.\nIn a sense, that makes this more like a scene from the embryonic days of any number of Silicon Valley giants—think Google or Yahoo—that sprouted from similarly cramped spaces and grew to employ tens of thousands of people. Chaudhary and Don have come here, three miles east of the world’s most famous venture-capital firms, to capture that same entrepreneurial spirit. With nearly $2 million from private investors, the 25-year-old hopefuls have launched one of America’s hottest educational-technology start-ups. They want to revolutionize the way teachers manage classroom behavior, using a software program that tracks student conduct.\n“Anyone who has taught in the classroom will tell you that the single biggest problem is managing classroom behavior,” Chaudhary recently told a roundtable here in Palo Alto that included White House aides, immigrant entrepreneurs, and education-technology experts. “We want to move beyond test scores, to reward character traits like teamwork and empathy.”\nTeachers swear that their program makes a difference. In a year or two, if things break right, ClassDojo’s software could be entrenched in thousands of classrooms—that is, should Chaudhary and Don manage to stay in the country long enough to keep their company afloat. But, naturally, that’s the problem.\nChaudhary and Don are not American citizens; and, despite the urgent need to create jobs and foster innovation, the United States does not hand out visas to entrepreneurs, even ones with sound ideas, financial backing, and a willingness to hire. If the two do not obtain long-term work visas by April, their plans—not to mention their investors’ money and the jobs they’re creating—will be in jeopardy. “So few start-ups succeed for a host of business-related reasons,” said Chaudhary, who has pleaded their case to anyone who will listen, including the Obama administration. “It seems ludicrous that what would kill a start-up would be immigration problems.”\nBut anyone who has spent serious time in Washington won’t find that notion ludicrous at all. Chaudhary and Don appear stuck, even though politicians from both parties are eager to import high-skilled, resourceful entrepreneurs to help make America more competitive with rest of the world. Congress hasn’t come close to being able to provide people like them with any relief—or take any other step toward resolving the nation’s larger immigration dilemma.\nBut beyond that, this is a story about how the government can’t solve problems, even ones with popular solutions. And if it can’t fix the simple ones, how can it be expected to tackle the nation’s more intractable woes?\nAt a time when Democrats and Republicans can’t seem to agree on anything, welcoming highly skilled workers like Chaudhary and Don is one rare area of consensus. “You’ve got incredibly talented people who want to start businesses in this country or to work in this country, and we should want those folks here in the United States,” President Obama said just last week.\n“I’d staple a green card to the diploma of anybody who’s got a degree in math, science, a master’s degree, Ph.D. We want those brains in our country,” Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential front-runner, said on the campaign trail last year.\n“The political climate made it impossible to move forward” on a sweeping immigration reform bill that a group of House Democrats and Republicans had negotiated in secret during the previous Congress. —Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California\nEconomists generally agree that skilled foreign workers benefit the economy and contribute greatly to the country’s innovative activity. A 2005 World Bank working paper estimated that a 10 percent increase in the number of foreign graduate students would raise patent applications by 4.7 percent. The academic debates about whether immigration harms the American labor market cluster around lower-skilled jobs and questions of legal-versus-illegal immigration, issues that have nothing to do with entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley.\nThe American public also approves of skilled immigrants, even in the midst of the highly charged rhetoric that surrounds the recent wave of harsh state laws modeled on Arizona’s tough immigration-enforcement law. Last year, a global poll on attitudes about immigration from the German Marshall Fund found that 63 percent of U.S. respondents believed their country should let in more immigrants with a high level of education. By contrast, only 36 percent said that the United States should let in more immigrants with low education levels.\nDYSFUNCTION JUNCTION\nThe only legislation that might help ClassDojo’s founders—a White House-backed bill that would grant a two-year visa for entrepreneurs who have lined up a U.S. investor—has no prospect of passage. It goes without saying that any large-scale effort to reform the nation’s immigration laws is doomed in the current atmosphere. The last major public push, in 2007, fell short.\nDuring the previous Congress, a group of House Democrats and Republicans negotiated a new, sweeping reform bill in secret, but it has never seen the light of day. The issue is so radioactive on the Hill that the proposed bill was watermarked to keep its contents from getting out and the identities of the negotiators hidden. And once a wave of tea party conservatives helped shift control of Congress back to the GOP, that was the end of any hope for a deal.\n“The political climate made it impossible to move forward,” said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., who helped negotiate the bill. Sworn to secrecy, she won’t give up the name of a single Republican involved in the talks.\nLofgren, however, found common ground with Republicans on a small-scale measure that aims to ease the path to citizenship for some high-skilled workers like Chaudhary and Don—and it happens to be the only piece of legislation that’s showing any signs of life. H.R. 3012 is a simple, bipartisan bill that would shorten the wait times for work visas for people from countries that generate large numbers of engineers and scientists. It’s nowhere near the size and lacks the complexity of past immigration-reform packages that sparked nationwide protests. Yet despite the bill’s modest goals and widespread support, Congress still is struggling to move it.\nThe bill, termed the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act, would remove per-country quotas on work visas. Under the current system, Iceland—a small country not known for producing highly skilled workers bound for the U.S.—gets allotted the same number of visas as China. The legislation would not add to the overall number of available green cards, but it would ease the immense backlogs for applicants from India and China, home to most of the superskilled immigrants. Some face waits of up to 70 years while they languish in the United States on an endlessly renewing loop of temporary work visas. They can’t change jobs or vote, and their spouses can’t work.\nThe idea for the bill originated with Lofgren, but she needed a Republican in the House to back it. Enter Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a 44-year-old GOP rising star, who introduced H.R. 3012 on Sept. 22. There was some irony here. Chaffetz represents Utah’s 3rd Congressional District, one of the most conservative in the country. In 2008, he unseated a 12-year incumbent in a scrappy Republican primary by portraying him as soft on immigration. Then-Rep. Chris Cannon had supported legislation to give undocumented immigrants the chance to earn citizenship. To defeat him, Chaffetz adopted what is now the Republican mantra: opposition to “amnesty” in any form.\nChaffetz said he signed onto the bill because he wants to help businesses do something about their immigration woes. It’s about as far he can go in easing the citizenship path for some foreigners. He isn’t sanctioning amnesty or adding to the overall numbers of immigrants, and it’s a bill crafted to pass the most divided of bodies. “There are some basic, simple fixes that we could put in place,” Chaffetz told National Journal from his hometown of Alpine. “The people that are most concerned about the immigration issue, they don’t want to see a net increase in the number of people.”\nThe legislation sailed through the House on a 389-15 vote. It passed on a Tuesday evening, under a procedure reserved for minor bills like naming post offices or congratulating Super Bowl champions. The vote barely made news in a week marked by reports of Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Barney Frank’s retirement and a controversial bill to rein in the National Labor Relations Board. None of the top House leaders—Republican or Democrat—issued congratulatory statements, even though the measure marked a rare moment of agreement on immigration policy. Their thoughts were in a thousand other places.\nCHASING AN EARRING\nAs soon as the bill left the House, it ran smack into Sen. Chuck Grassley. The Iowa Republican almost immediately put a hold on the bill, a procedural maneuver that allows senators to essentially block legislation from being debated on the floor.\nAt 78, Grassley—a plainspoken conservative with a penchant for sweater vests—has spent almost half his life in Congress. He supported President Reagan’s 1986 immigration-reform law, which, by giving amnesty to undocumented workers and increasing enforcement and sanctions, was billed as the solution to illegal immigration. Like many Republicans who supported that law, he now feels he was sold a bill of goods.\n“You know what I found out? You reward illegality and you get more of it,” Grassley said in his Senate office. “So that’s why I can’t be for amnesty again, or somebody’s going to say, ‘Grassley, can’t you learn from your mistakes?’ And I can learn from my mistakes.”\nThe Iowan doesn’t object in principle to removing per-country green-card quotas. Rather, he wants to use Chaffetz’s bill for his own purposes—to reform the guest-worker visa system that companies use to bring high-skilled foreign workers into the country temporarily. The program has problems with fraud: 20 percent of the so-called H-1B visas issued do not meet the law’s criteria, he said, citing a 2008 Homeland Security Department report. Slots that are supposed to go to individuals with specialized training are instead being used as a gateway for low-skilled workers.\n“It’s the only immigration bill that’s going to be around for two years. So if you want to get some reforms, you take every opportunity you can to take an immigration bill and [fix] other things wrong with immigration.” —Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, on the Chaffetz bill\nWith comprehensive immigration reform long dead, Grassley has taken his fight on visa fraud to the only immigration bill moving this year—H.R. 3012.\nHe is not the only one looking to add a little something to the bill. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wants to tack on a special visa category for Irish nationals. Schumer is not Irish, but he represents a lot of Ireland partisans. He argues that the Irish have been waiting patiently, like everyone else, for a broad immigration overhaul that would give them more opportunities to come to the U.S. The European country that sent some 3 million immigrants to America after the 1845 potato famine now feels slighted for being left out of special visa categories created under free-trade agreements for others, such as Chile and Singapore.\nTrying to determine exactly how the popular Chaffetz proposal got mired in this mess is like chasing an earring down a sink drain. To sum up:\n• Grassley says he is willing to lift his hold on H.R. 3012 if Schumer backs off his Irish-visa proposal.\n• Schumer says that Democrats aren’t the holdup; it’s actually a Republican, Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts, who shot his mouth off to a bunch of Irish constituents back home, saying that the Irish-visa bill was “about to pop.” Massachusetts—where Brown expects a tough reelection fight—is the hub of the Ireland lobby.\n• Brown says he has not placed a hold on the Chaffetz proposal and supports it in principle. But he also wants the Irish-visa bill to pass, and he won’t say whether he would block the Chaffetz bill if the Irish measure doesn’t move with it.\n• Grassley, meanwhile, has offered Schumer a chance for an up-or-down vote on the Irish-visa bill, provided the required skill levels get tweaked and the special-visa program has an end date. There’s no word yet on whether Schumer will accept the offer.\nAnd so, H.R. 3012 sits.\n“It’s the only immigration bill that’s probably going to be around for two years,” Grassley said, “so if you want to get some reforms, you take every opportunity you can to take an immigration bill and [fix] other things that are wrong with immigration.”\nGrassley’s tactic is exactly what makes passing small, targeted legislation so tough. Pretty soon, a simple, six-page bill is loaded down with pet projects that make it impossible to pass muster. “I’m only adding one thing,” he said. “Anybody trying to add anything to any other bill, you know what you call them? U.S. senator—because that’s what the Senate’s all about. No limit on debate. It’s the deliberating body. Anybody can bring up anything.”\nSOMEBODY ELSE’S PROBLEM\nThe slow walk of the Chaffetz bill in the Senate infuriates leaders in the technology sector, whose companies depend on high-skilled labor. Asked about the legislation, the president of TechNet, which represents the nation’s top tech CEOs, sputtered in frustration.\n“That bill,” Rey Ramsey said before pausing and starting over. “I’m trying to calm myself, because it’s just stunning the partisanship and ineffectiveness to be able to move something that’s so important for the economy.”\nIn February, about 40 senior TechNet executives spent a day on Capitol Hill meeting with Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate. They left exasperated. “When you sum up the CEOs’ sentiments, it was a frustration at fingers being pointed and not a clear-enough glide path for reso-lution,” Ramsey said. “This is an unacceptable and unsustainable way to do the country’s business.”\nIn meeting after meeting, the tech executives heard Democrats and Republicans blame each other for inaction.\nIn the morning, the group met with about two dozen Senate Democrats. Before greetings could even be exchanged, according to one participant, Majority Leader Harry Reid began attacking Republicans for holding up the Chaffetz bill. Later, Schumer suggested some questions that the executives should put to Republicans. One did, irritating Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who accused Democrats of demagoguing the issue at tech leaders’ afternoon meeting with about a dozen GOP senators.\nThings didn’t go much smoother in the House. In a meeting with Republicans, Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia and Whip Kevin McCarthy of California hit the right talking points on high-skilled immigration, but they did little to convince tech leaders they were serious about reform. “Cantor chimed in and said, ‘This is an important issue, and there’s bipartisan agreement, and we want to get something done,’ ” said a tech-industry leader who attended the meeting. “It was very much a platitude.”\nIn the same meeting, Chaffetz told the executives to go talk to Grassley. It drove home the message from lawmakers: It’s not our fault. Talk to the other guy.\nTech leaders don’t understand why House Republicans can’t persuade their Senate brethren to pass Chaffetz’s bill. “Grassley is holding your damn bill up. That’s where the CEOs were incredulous,” said another participant in the House GOP meeting.\nTheir frustration is understandable, but it also speaks to a major disconnect between Silicon Valley’s agile innovators and a politically hamstrung Congress that can barely keep the government afloat. “I love them. They’re my constituents,” said Lofgren of the tech lobby. “But their idea is that they’ll fly in some CEOs, spend a day, go back to the valley, and you’ll see them again next year.” These executives, accustomed to solving problems with the click of a mouse, are strangers in a land where decisions are years in the making and influence is accumulated over decades.\nTech leaders know they have to do more to engage Washington, particularly Republicans, who have traditionally enjoyed less political support from the liberal-leaning Silicon Valley than Democrats. TechNet is planning a major valley fundraiser for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky this spring. A major goal of the event will be pressing the Republican leader to urge Grassley to lift his hold on the Chaffetz bill. The organization is also talking to former Hewlett-Packard chief executive and Republican Senate candidate Carly Fiorina about building stronger relationships with congressional Republicans.\nAs Ramsey put it, “We’ve got to transcend the traditions and dysfunction that we’ve fallen into. And I’ve never heard more unanimity on an issue than this issue.”\nNO WAY IN\n“Dojo” means “place of the way” in Japanese. But right now, ClassDojo cofounders Chaudhary and Don don’t seem to have a way forward. Even if the Chaffetz bill were to suddenly clear the Senate, it would be of no use to them.\nUntil now, the start-up had been building momentum. ClassDojo’s big break arrived in May of last year, via a Skype interview from London with Imagine K12, a Silicon Valley business incubator founded by former Google and Yahoo executives. ClassDojo was among 10 start-ups chosen to receive about $20,000 in seed money, along with mentoring and introductions to local talent. The offer was contingent on relocating to California. Two weeks later, 90-day visas in hand, Chaudhary and Don were on a plane to America.\n“Entrepreneurs don’t take jobs away from Americans. By definition, we are creating jobs,” Chaudhary said. “Besides, there isn’t a fixed pool of Americans. Find the smartest, most creative people in the world and make them Americans.”\nChaudhary is tall, with a British accent, scruffy chin, and hipster glasses. He obsesses about going to the gym, uses expensive shampoo, and tries to eat lean protein and fresh fruit when he is not ordering takeout from his neighborhood deli. He is ridiculously talented. He graduated with honors in in economics at Cambridge University, where he rowed and played water polo, rugby, volleyball, and basketball. He passed up an offer from an investment-banking firm to teach high school for a semester. After two years at a prestigious consulting firm, he left to start ClassDojo. Don, equally brilliant, walked away from offers of music-recording contracts and a Ph.D. in computer science at the University of Durham.\nClassDojo operates like a virtual version of the grade-school sticker chart. A teacher awards students points for good conduct throughout the school day by computer. The student’s name, along with a credit in the appropriate category—generosity, participation, insight, hard work, persistence, creativity—appear on a screen for all the class to see. At the end of the week, the software calculates the number of points each student lost or gained in each category, creating a detailed progress report sent home to parents.\nTheir concept quickly gained traction. It won the top prize in an Innovation in Education contest sponsored by NBC and Citigroup, landing Chaudhary and Don $75,000 and an appearance on the Today show. ClassDojo was the only company from its Imagine K12 class that raised money from other well-known angel investors and venture capitalists. Chaudhary and Don can’t earn any money themselves on their current visas, but they have already hired three people and plan to hire three more this summer.\nWhy not just launch ClassDojo in London? It would never work, its founders say. The incentives to be here are not so different from what drives a Haitian to climb aboard a raft or a Mexican to climb over a fence. The overachieving, smarter-than-you playpen that is Silicon Valley—replete with Stanford University graduates on bikes, dry-erase boards that double as coffee tables, and drip coffee hand-brewed one organic cup at a time—is a unique breeding ground for start-ups.\n“You’ve got the talent—so many incredible developers here,” Chaudhary said. “You have people who have built successful technology companies and want to give back to the next generation with money, and time, and introductions. That is really difficult to replicate anywhere in the world.”\nIn contrast to the Senate’s languid, almost dreamlike sense of time, Chaudhary and Don face a hard deadline for the future of ClassDojo. Obtaining long-term work visas is even more challenging than building a company from scratch. Because the annual supply of 65,000 H-1B visas was tapped out, they had to go back to London for a few days in July and for a few months at the end of last year, delays that could have wiped out their business. The young men returned in January with another temporary visa, and the clock started running again.\nWhen they made their case in Palo Alto, they sat down with White House officials who offered them little beyond resigned sympathy. Instead of scaling up their company and bringing on staff, Chaudhary told the officials at the roundtable, “we’re spending so much time navigating the system and trying to fit into a visa category that’s not designed for entrepreneurs.”\n“That’s because there isn’t one,” quipped Doug Rand, a senior policy adviser in the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy, attending the meeting on behalf of the Obama administration. The White House delegation wore dark-blue suits, while the rest of table were clad in standard-issue California-casual—hooded sweatshirts, T-shirts, and jeans.\nChaudhary appreciated the chance to make his pitch, but the meeting meant three hours away from ClassDojo. “It’s kind of an awful trade-off, because my primary responsibility is to my company and employees,” he said.\nCompanies throughout the United States are experiencing the same problems as they find their business decisions being dictated by immigration policy that doesn’t work. Employers want to sponsor workers for green cards, but they can’t wait five years or longer for their workers, so they try to bring them in on H-1B visas. Almost every year, the allotted number of H-1B visas is exhausted within weeks. This fiscal year, which started on Oct. 1, Homeland Security stopped accepting applications on Nov. 22. Before the economic downturn, the 65,000 available visas were exhausted within the first few days after they were made available, a full six months before the visa holders could actually start their jobs.\nThe most logical immigration route for Chaudhary and Don would be green cards, but that option doesn’t exist for them. Green cards are doled out based on having U.S. citizen family members or having employers who sponsor the applicants and can prove that Americans aren’t available to do the job. Chaudhary and Don have neither.\nTheir last-ditch hope is the so-called O-1 visa, most often used for celebrities and Nobel Prize winners. The criteria for this “extraordinary ability” category include nationally or internationally recognized awards, membership in a professional association, authorship of scholarly articles, and proof of the ability to command a high salary.\nThat’s not likely to happen, just as, right now, it’s not likely that ClassDojo will be a classroom fixture in the United States one day—or that there will ever be enough green cards available for skilled workers, or that there will be a solution for the 12 million undocumented aliens in the country. America doesn’t seem to be able to solve those kinds of problems anymore. \nThis is the first in a series that examines America’s crumbling foundations and how to rebuild them.\nGet the latest news and analysis delivered to your inbox.

Smith-USA TODAY Sports\nCarmelo Anthony  was the NBA \u0027s leading scorer and led the New York Knicks to the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference. Yet, the All-Star forward is not at the forefront of the MVP discussion. LeBron James is expected to win the award for the fourth time, with Kevin Durant finishing a distant second. \nJames is the biggest impediment to Anthony winning the MVP. LeBron shot 57 percent from the field, 41 percent from three, finished second in Defensive Player of the Year voting and produced the seventh-highest player efficiency rating (31.59) in NBA history ( via Basketball-Reference.com ).\nAnthony\u0027s exclusion from the MVP discussion is also based in large part on the perception that he is a one-dimensional player. That characterization is not completely accurate.\n\u0027Melo grabbed 6.9 rebounds per game, and his low assist numbers (2.6 per game) were misleading. It usually takes at least two passes to find the open man against sophisticated defenses, and Carmelo often initiated the Knicks\u0027 ball movement by passing out of double-teams.\nHowever, it is impossible to ignore that Durant and James topped Anthony in every major statistical category other than scoring ( via Basketball-Reference.com ).\nPlayer\n0.9\n26.8\nChris Paul , who will likely finish in the top five in MVP voting, led the league in steals (2.41) and finished second in assists (9.7), in addition to scoring 16.9 points per game.\nThe scoring numbers do not even necessarily work in Anthony\u0027s favor. James and Durant averaged a comparable number of points, with much greater efficiency. Anthony\u0027s field-goal and three-point percentages (45 and 38, respectively) were well below those of James (57 and 41 percent, respectively) and Durant (51 and 42 percent, respectively) ( via Basketball-Reference.com ).\nPlayer\n.406\n25.5\nThe biggest difference between the three forwards was on defense. According to Synergy Sports , Anthony held opponents to .62 points per possession on post-up plays, which ranked 12th in the league. However, he struggled to stay with his man on isolation plays or when forced to run around screens, and his poor help defense left the Knicks vulnerable at times along the back line.\nJames is a defensive stopper, capable of guarding all five positions, and Durant\u0027s freakish wingspan disrupts shooters and takes away passing lanes. Both compete harder than Anthony, who has a tendency to jog back on defense and take defensive possessions off.\nThe Knicks\u0027 record also does not work in Carmelo\u0027s favor. New York won 54 games, seventh most in the league.   \nThe MVP trophy is generally awarded to the best player on one of the elite teams, and James\u0027 Miami Heat won a league-high 66 games. Anthony\u0027s inferior supporting cast helps his case, but is ultimately outweighed by the size of the gap between the Heat and Knicks (12 wins) and Miami\u0027s historic 27-game winning streak.\nLeBron James and the Miami Heat won 66 games, including 27 in a row.\nGreg M. Cooper-USA TODAY Sports\nDurant also had more talent around him than Anthony, notably a second superstar in Russell Westbrook. The Oklahoma City Thunder  only won six more games than the Knicks (60), though voters will note that they did so in the superior Western Conference.\nJames and Durant had a greater impact on their teams\u0027 success because they were in the lineup more frequently than Anthony. The Knicks star missed 15 games (18 percent of the season) with an assortment of injuries.\nDurant missed just one game, and LeBron six, though they were all after the Heat had wrapped up the No. 1 seed. Chris Paul, like Anthony, dropped out of the MVP running due to an injury. The Los Angeles Clippers point guard was sidelined for 12 games in January and February with a sore knee.\nVoters are only supposed to consider the 2012-13 regular season, but players\u0027 reputations inevitably creep into the decision-making process. Carmelo rubbed many people the wrong way when he forced his way out of  Denver  and his reputation has been diminished by a lack of playoff success.\nThere is also a lag effect to awards such as the MVP, All-NBA honors and All-Star teams. Players typically play at an elite level for a few years before they are recognized for their achievements. Anthony has not performed at an MVP level for multiple seasons like Durant and James.\nCarmelo had an excellent season and he should finish among the top five in the MVP voting. But his game pales in comparison to LeBron\u0027s and so does his candidacy.\n","source":"google_52778141777464"}

Not Wilt Chamberlain, not Bill Russell, not Shaquille O\u0027Neal, not Michael Jordan.\nLeBron James might soon change that.\nAt least, the Miami Heat believe he should.\nAfter finally winning that first NBA title last June, James was better than ever in his first year as a champion. He led the league in field goals, despite being seventh in shots attempted. He established career-bests in shooting percentage, 3-point percentage, rebounds per game and double-doubles - and did it all while taking fewer shots per game than at any point in his 10-year career.\nSo those are just a few of the many reasons why the Heat are overwhelming favorites to win it all once again in these playoffs, which open this weekend. Miami will meet Milwaukee in a first-round series starting Sunday night.\n\"Numbers aren\u0027t why I play this game of basketball,\" James said. \"Numbers have never been why I play the game. That\u0027s not how I was taught to play the game.\"\nJames has said he plays for only one thing - titles.\n\"He came off one of the more historical MVP seasons with a championship. Most people, the human condition would have been to relax and say, \u0027OK, that\u0027s the pinnacle,\u0027\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \"But instead, he wanted to push and find another barrier. And that\u0027s why we don\u0027t want to, he doesn\u0027t want to, put a ceiling on how far he can go. ... He\u0027s a player that could conceivably continue to get better.\"\nJames shot 56.5 percent this season and made 103 3-pointers - no one in league history has ever shot so well and made so many shots in a season from beyond the arc. In the metric known as PAR, that being an acronym for points, assists and rebounds per game, James led the league by for the fifth time in six seasons. He led the league in field goals, but was only seventh in shots attempted. He could have missed 348 more shots and still finished with a better shooting percentage than scoring champion Carmelo Anthony.\n\"It\u0027s a historic regular season,\" said Heat forward Shane Battier, who believes James should be the unanimous MVP. \"We may never see numbers like this and performance like this - on both ends - like we saw this year.\"\nJames\u0027 final numbers: 26.8 points, 8 rebounds, 7.3 assists and 1.7 steals per game. Since the league began charting steals four decades ago, only Jordan and Larry Bird have put up similar numbers in a season.\n\"I\u0027ve been playing this game for a long, long time,\" Heat forward Udonis Haslem said. \"I\u0027ve seen a lot of players. I\u0027ve played in Europe, played in a lot of different places and hands-down he\u0027s the best basketball player I\u0027ve ever seen. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything he can\u0027t do on the basketball court.\"\nThe Heat were 61-15 with James in the lineup this season, going 21-10 when he took 19 shots or more, and 40-5 - a significantly better record - when he took no more than 18 attempts. When he had at least eight assists, they were darn close to unbeatable, going 28-3 in those contests.\nAnd he nearly put up a perfect shooting game along the way this season, going 13 for 14 in a win over Charlotte. The one miss was a layup, and it appeared he was fouled.\n\"Greatness always looks for something to get better,\" said Doug Collins, who coached Philadelphia this season. \"I had the great fortune of being around Michael Jordan and he always came back a better player. ... And that\u0027s what LeBron has done, the way he\u0027s shooting the ball, over 40 percent from 3, 56 percent from the field. You get him in the open court, you can\u0027t stop him. Not only that, but he\u0027s the best defensive player in the league at his position.\"\nJames said many times that last season was his best season, for plenty of obvious reasons. He got engaged, won an Olympic gold medal, a third NBA MVP award and of course helped the Heat win a championship - his first, after years and years of trying to break through.\nAfter a year like that, he took about three weeks off. And other than a slight hamstring strain that slowed him down the stretch of the regular season, he\u0027s been no worse for that wear.\nIf he isn\u0027t the MVP the league announces the voting in a few weeks, it\u0027ll be probably the biggest upset in the history of sports. It would be James\u0027 fourth in five years, and plenty of people around him insist that the one year in that span where he didn\u0027t win - the year it went to Derrick Rose - that was voters thumbing their nose at both the his decision to join the Heat and the manner in which that move was announced.\n\"The other day I was sitting there with him, a week or two ago and it dawned on me, \u0027Do you know you\u0027re about to get four MVPs in five years?\u0027 And he\u0027s like, \u0027Man, I\u0027m just a kid from Akron,\u0027\" Heat guard Dwyane Wade said. \"He could have gotten five in five. Five in five years. This is crazy. He can do whatever he wants on the court. Certain people have certain things they can\u0027t do. He can do everything. Can he be the greatest of all time? He could be.\"\nJames was not with the Heat for their season-finale, tending instead to a personal matter. He is expected to be there Friday when the Heat convene for their first postseason practice, and Spoelstra said there is no cause for alarm about James\u0027 postseason availability.\nAll his numbers this season would be for naught if the year doesn\u0027t end with another champagne bath.\n\"You think he\u0027s peaked, that he\u0027s the best basketball player in the world and he comes back better,\" Haslem said. \"Scary to see what he could possibly be next year.\"\nCopyright 2013 The Associated Press.

Indiana Pacers\u0027 Paul George, left, grabs a rebound from Atlanta Hawks\u0027 DeShawn Stevenson during the second half of Game 1 in the first round of the NBA basketball playoffs on Sunday, April 21, 2013, in Indianapolis.\nBy MICHAEL MAROT\nAP Sports Writer\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Pacers forward Paul George spent the past summer turning himself into a better player.\nNow he\u0027s planning to dedicate himself to becoming the NBA\u0027s best all-around player.\nA few minutes after accepting the league\u0027s Most Improved Player Award, the 6-foot-9 swingman promised to work even harder to attain the biggest rewards of all - an NBA title and perhaps an MVP.\n\"I think I can play at an MVP level. I think that\u0027s very much within reach,\" George said Tuesday. \"For me, it\u0027s all about being consistent and having that aggressive mindset.\"\nGeorge has already emerged as one of the league\u0027s top young players, which explains his runaway victory in the balloting. He received 52 of 120 first-place votes and 311 points, more than double the total of New Orleans\u0027 Greivis Vasquez, who had 13 first-place votes and 146 points. Milwaukee\u0027s Larry Sanders was third with 141 points and was one of three players to receive 10 first-place votes.\nAs part of the award, a 2012 Kia Sorrento will be donated to the Hawthorne Community Center, George\u0027s hand-picked charity.\nGeorge is also expected to be one of the top vote-getters for the Defensive Player of the Year Award, an honor coach Frank Vogel lobbied hard for Tuesday.\nThe question is whether George has what it takes to challenge for the league\u0027s top individual honor.\n\"With the physical talent he has, with the drive he has, there\u0027s no ceiling for him,\" Vogel said.\nIf 2012-13 proved anything, it\u0027s that George is a man of his word.\nBefore leaving town after last season\u0027s Eastern Conference semifinal loss to LeBron James and eventual champion Miami, George walked into Vogel\u0027s office and promised to come back with a more aggressive mindset and as a more versatile scorer.\nLeBron James\u0027 guidance helped him reach those goals.\nThe two worked out together in Las Vegas as the U.S. team prepared for the Olympics, but all the while George was watching and learning from the best - not just James.\n\"It was huge. Me, growing up, idolizing guys like Kobe, watching his whole regimen, watching what time he got up to work out, watching what he was putting in his body,\" George said. \"The younger guys, we was totally the opposite, so I had to kind of take notes and follow what they were doing.\"\nThe results impressed his teammates, coaches and many around the league.\nGeorge averaged 17.4 points and 7.6 rebounds this season, both career highs, and was the only player in the league with at least 140 steals and 50 blocks. He earned his first All-Star appearance, led Indiana to its first Central Division crown in nine years and became the fourth Pacers player to win the Most Improved Player Award since 2000. The others were Jalen Rose, Jermaine O\u0027Neal and Danny Granger.\nIn 2011-12, George averaged 12.1 points and 5.6 rebounds and made just 19 of 52 shots from the field in the 4-2 playoff loss to the Heat.\nGranger, for one, isn\u0027t surprised by George\u0027s success.\n\"I was working out with Paul and a couple of other players about five days before the (2010) draft and Larry Bird called and asked me what I thought about him. I told him, \u0027You better draft him,\u0027\" Granger said. \"Sometimes you have talent viewing players and seeing what they can do for a team. He had that talent and, at 6-9, Paul possesses a lot of ability a lot of guys don\u0027t have.\"\nThe announcement came less than 48 hours after George played his most complete game of the season. He joined Mark Jackson as the only players in franchise history to record a triple double in the NBA playoffs. George finished with 23 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists in the Pacers\u0027 107-90 Game 1 win over Atlanta - giving Indiana its first 1-0 series lead since 2006. Game 2 is Wednesday night in Indy.\nAfter showing steady improvement through each of his first two NBA seasons, George finally got his chance to lead when Granger went down with a left knee injury. Granger, Indiana\u0027s top scorer the previous five seasons, played in only five games.\nSo George took it upon himself to make up for the absence.\n\"He\u0027s a rare breed with his purity for the game and his willingness to play team basketball at both ends of the court and his drive to get better,\" Vogel said. \"I think he was ready to explode whether Danny was in or out.\"\nDespite shooting just 3 of 13 from the field Sunday, George made his first 17 foul shots to tie Reggie Miller\u0027s postseason mark for best free-throw percentage in a single game, then missed his 18th and final attempt.\nSoon he was picking up his first big award.\nHe doesn\u0027t expect it to be his last.\n\"A lot of players don\u0027t get an opportunity to make the playoffs and have a team that can win the championship,\" George said. \"Coach says all the time that this could be your last time in the playoffs. So I\u0027ve really not focused on where I need to get better or thought about the offseason yet.\"\nCopyright 2013 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

He trash-talked.\nAnd he won, getting to watch his teammates do 20 push-ups as his reward.\nThere is a certain irony in James staying on the court after practice to work on his shooting, especially since there are nights he controls games without looking to score. When he took 11 shots in an NBA Finals game two years ago, he became a lightning rod for criticism.\nThese days, an 11-shot game from James - like what he had Sunday when the Heat won Game 1 of their Eastern Conference first-round series against Milwaukee - gets celebrated for effective brilliance. He\u0027s controlling the game in any number of ways, and will try to continue doing so when the Heat and Bucks meet in Game 2 of the best-of-seven matchup on Tuesday night in Miami.\n\"The narrative has changed about him, about our team,\" Heat forward Shane Battier said. \"A championship changes that. I don\u0027t think LeBron\u0027s changed. That\u0027s who LeBron is. LeBron\u0027s going to make the smart basketball play. He\u0027s going to make the right play. If that entails him taking 11 shots and we win, he\u0027s going to do it. If it entails him taking 30 shots, he\u0027s going to do it.\"\nJames will likely be named as the NBA\u0027s MVP for the fourth time in five seasons sometime in the not-too-distant future, and with each season, he still seems to be getting better.\nHe made 9 of 11 shots on Sunday in Miami\u0027s 110-87 win, finishing with 27 points and two assists shy of a triple-double. In his first seven-plus seasons, James never shot better than 75 percent in any game in which he took more than 10 shots. Since April 2011, he\u0027s done it 11 times, including Sunday, and the Heat are 11-0 in those games.\n\"We don\u0027t take his talent for granted because he does whatever it takes to help you win,\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said.\nWhen the Bucks broke down film after Game 1, coach Jim Boylan paid particular attention to the way his team defended James, a job that fell largely onto the shoulders of Luc Richard Mbah a Moute.\nBoylan raved about Mbah a Moute\u0027s effort after seeing that film. James was just too good in Game 1.\n\"It\u0027s hard to say, \u0027You didn\u0027t do this, you didn\u0027t do that\u0027 because Luc was into him the whole time,\" Boylan said. \"LeBron just had a great game.\"\nSo now the trick for the Bucks - who are 1-4 against Miami this season - is finding ways to get Brandon Jennings and Monta Ellis some help on the offensive end. Jennings and Ellis combined for 48 points in Game 1; their teammates chipped in only 39 more.\nIf that becomes a trend, the Bucks know they\u0027ll be on vacation by early next week.\n\"No one\u0027s in a panic,\" Boylan said. \"We\u0027ve played one game. It\u0027s time for us to take a look and see what we can do and figure out how we can help those guys.\"\nThere were some encouraging signs for the Bucks on Monday.\nCenter Larry Sanders, who has battled back pain in recent weeks and was marred by foul trouble that kept him from finding anything close to a rhythm in Game 1, said he felt as good Monday - 80 percent right was his estimation - as he has in a while. And Boylan said Ersan Ilyasova, who has dealt with a wrist problem, shouldn\u0027t still be adversely affected by that issue.\n\"For us, I don\u0027t think we look at it as it\u0027s a seven-game series and we\u0027ve got to win four out of seven,\" Bucks forward Mike Dunleavy said. \"We\u0027ve got to win one game. When we win one game, then we\u0027ll say, \u0027Hey, we\u0027ve got to win another one game.\u0027 To look at it as a whole and say we\u0027ve got to beat these guys four times out of seven when they haven\u0027t lost four times out of 50, it\u0027s monumental.\"\nThat team that Dunleavy said hasn\u0027t lost four times out of 50 - actually, the Heat are 43-4 in their last 47 games - looked at itself with very critical eyes on Monday.\nThe videotape session that Spoelstra arranged for the Heat at the start of practice Monday lasted an hour, and the clips were not ones the team particularly enjoyed seeing. A night loaded with mistakes were on display in high-definition. Some, including Dwyane Wade, said the scene had a day-after-a-loss feel.\nAnd remember, it was actually after a 23-point win.\n\"That\u0027s one thing Coach Spo does a great job of,\" Wade said. \"He\u0027s always making sure that we move on and we move into the new moment. That moment has passed. That\u0027s one thing he\u0027s been very consistent at.\"\nOne area where the Heat struggled in Game 1 was 3-point shooting, where they went 7 for 23. So maybe that was why James lured Allen and Chalmers into that post-practice contest.\nHe would yell at his shots, pleading with them to \"Get up\" or \"Sit down.\" When Chalmers or Allen would miss, James would shout \"That\u0027s what I needed.\" And when he took his final attempt, the one that clinched the game, James knew he\u0027d won when the ball was still in flight, saying \"Game time\" just before the shot went down.\n\"I\u0027ve got to stay ready, I guess,\" James said. \"I\u0027ve got to stay ready.\"\nCopyright 2013 The Associated Press.

Delfino was one of the defenders coach Kevin McHale was using on Kevin Durant and he made 11 3-pointers in the first four games of the series. Francisco Garcia and Chandler Parsons are going to have to avoid foul trouble while guarding Durant.\nTobias Harris not a lock to start in 2013/14\nTobias Harris is not considered a lock to start for the Magic in 2013-14.\nGlen Davis is expected to return from his fractured foot as the starting power forward. The Magic may not want to stunt the growth of exciting prospect Maurice Harkless at small forward, and Arron Afflalo is entrenched at shooting guard. Regardless, Harris is going to play a major role for Orlando whether he\u0027s starting or coming off the bench. His 17.3/8.5/2.1 triple slash over the final 27 games was eye-opening.\nBlake Griffin \u0027really is 50-50\u0027 for Game 6\nA Clippers source tells ESPN Los Angeles that Blake Griffin (ankle) \"really is 50-50\" for Friday\u0027s Game 6 against the Grizzlies.\nThe high right ankle sprain Griffin sustained during Monday\u0027s practice is the worst of his career. He went through a light workout Friday morning, but that doesn\u0027t tell us much. Even if Griffin does suit up, we wouldn\u0027t expect a full complement of minutes and touches. Lamar Odom is going to play a major role in Game 6.\nLeBron James set to win his fourth MVP award\nLeBron James will be formally named the NBA\u0027s Most Valuable Player Sunday.\nJames joins Michael Jordan, Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Wilt Chamberlain as the only players ever with at least four MVP awards. This year\u0027s balloting shouldn\u0027t even be close. James ranked fourth in points per game (26.8), 21st in rebounds (8.0), 10th in assists (7.3) and fourth in field-goal percentage (56.5). The Heat had the NBA\u0027s best record at 66-16, a mark that included a 27-game win streak -- the second longest run in league history. Still just 28 years old, James is compiling a resume of truly historic proportions.\nRose says \u0027muscle memory\u0027 holding him back\nDerrick Rose (knee) says \"muscle memory\" is one of the things holding him back from returning to action.\nTNT sideline reporter Rachel Nichols was able to secure a few minutes with Rose. \"He\u0027s telling me how badly he does want to be out there, but he says that he just doesn\u0027t have the muscle memory back, is the way he put it,\" Nichols said. In other words, Rose\u0027s knee doesn\u0027t feel right, it\u0027s affecting his shot and he doesn\u0027t want to be on the court when he\u0027s unsure of himself. Meanwhile, the rest of his Bulls teammates are slogging through a brutal series against the Nets, most of them playing on one leg or sick. \"I think Derrick owes it to his teammates at this stage,\" TNT\u0027s Steve Kerr said Monday.\nTerps C Alex Len out 4-6 months after surgery\nMaryland C Alex Len recently underwent ankle surgery and is out 4-6 months.\nIt\u0027s a crushing blow for Len. His name was starting to gain momentum as a possible top-5 pick, but he can almost certainly forget about that now. He\u0027ll miss the entire pre-draft process while simultaneously raising a huge red flag. Fired general managers\u0027 resumes are littered with 7-footers that have foot problems. Len is dealing with a stress fracture in his ankle.\nLuol Deng (illness) back in emergency room\nLuol Deng (illness) tweeted Friday that he is back in the emergency room.\nThis isn\u0027t some mere flu bug. Deng may have to spend the Friday night in the ER after his symptoms worsened in the morning. No one should be questioning his heart as he is one of the toughest players in the entire NBA. He sounds extremely doubtful for Saturday night\u0027s Game 7 in Brooklyn, but we wouldn\u0027t put anything past him. Deng said that if he gets medically cleared, he\u0027ll hop on a flight Saturday morning and join his teammates.\nAndre Iguodala expected to opt out of deal\nAndre Iguodala is expected to opt out of the final year of his contract.\nIguodala is on the books for a hefty $16M in 2013-14. But at age 29, he\u0027ll exercise an opt-out clause, become an unrestricted free agent and go hunting for one more mammoth deal. As one of the league\u0027s premier wing defenders and an excellent distributor from the small forward spot, he\u0027ll get it. The Nuggets have the financial flexibility to pay Iguodala, but it\u0027s uncertain if they\u0027ll be his strongest suitor. He\u0027ll test the market.\nKirk Hinrich traveling, game-time for Game 7\nKirk Hinrich (calf) is traveling with the Bulls to Brooklyn for Game 7, and although he\u0027s feeling better, he\u0027ll be a game-time decision vs. the Nets.\nHinrich\u0027s availability would be huge with Luol Deng (illness) iffy and Derrick Rose (knee) still sidelined, but we won\u0027t know his status until he\u0027s able to test out his calf before tipoff. ESPN Chicago is calling Hinrich a game-time decision, but the Chicago Tribune is calling him doubtful. Either way, he\u0027ll have to prove capable of playing before the Bulls let him get on the floor. Chicago has battled injuries all season and it would be a pretty big illustration of the team\u0027s fortitude if they\u0027re able to get out of the first round. If Hinrich can\u0027t go, it would be the Nate Robinson show once again.\n","source":"google_52778141777464"}

Scott was strapped with a young, inexperienced squad but owner Dan Gilbert didn\u0027t think the Cavs made adequate progress â€” especially on defense â€” with him so he\u0027s handed his team back to the same coach he fired three years ago.\nBrown\u0027s return to Cleveland isn\u0027t really all that surprising.\nThe Cavs wanted a successful, defensive-minded coach and they had their greatest success in five seasons under Brown, who was certainly helped by having James on his teams. But he has made the playoffs in all six seasons as an NBA head coach, and shown the ability to develop younger players during his first stint with Cleveland.\nThe Cavs won at least 45 games each season during Brown\u0027s tenure and went 66-16 in 2008-09 when he was named NBA Coach of the Year.\nHis teams in Cleveland always played solid defense, ranking among the top in most categories. James has credited Brown with making him a better defensive player and getting him to understand the importance of defending the basket. Brown, though, was criticized for a stagnant offense that too often relied simply on James\u0027 marvelous athletic skills, especially late in games.\nBrown was fired by Gilbert after the Cavs were beaten in the 2010 playoffs by Boston. James was accused of quitting on the team during that series and there was tension in the final weeks between the league MVP and his coach.\nBut Brown\u0027s firing was more about Gilbert trying to make James happy and persuade him to re-sign, a strategy that ultimately didn\u0027t work when the superstar went to Miami.\nBrown left Cleveland on good terms, which would take some of the awkwardness out of his return.\nEven before Scott\u0027s firing, which seemed inevitable as the Cavs staggered to the end of the season by losing 16 of their last 18, Brown was looking for houses to return to Cleveland. He\u0027ll be closer to his oldest son, who will be a freshman basketball player at Butler next season and his younger son intends to finish high school with friends he made when his dad previously coached the Cavs.\nBrown is inheriting a team with a bright future. As long as he can stay healthy, All-Star guard Kyrie Irving will only improve and in Anderson Varejao, Dion Waiters, Tristan Thompson and Tyler Zeller, the Cavs have a solid nucleus.\nCleveland has two first-round picks in June\u0027s NBA draft, the team has plenty of salary-cap space and Grant said last week that he intends to be aggressive in free agency this summer.\n___\nAP Basketball Writer Jon Krawczynski contributed to this report from Minneapolis.\nShare this story\n","source":"google_52778141777464"}

The only question now is the margin by which James wins the award.\nThe Heat, currently idle after sweeping the Milwaukee Bucks, have scheduled an awards presentation Sunday. NBA Commissioner David Stern will present James with the MVP trophy at the beginning of the second-round series next week.\nJames led the Heat to a franchise-best 66-16 record and a franchise record 27-game winning streak. Currently in his tenth season, James averaged 26.8 points, 8.0 rebounds, 7.3 assists, 1.7 steals and one block in 76 games. He shot career-best percentages from the field (.565) and 3-point range (.406).\nHead coach Erik Spoelstra said James has earned the MVP title this season. From ESPN’s report:\n“He’s having an even more historic season than he’s had the last two years. Most people probably didn’t think he could go to a higher level after last season, yet he reinvented himself to show that he could. Our pinch-ourselves moment was when we signed him. But since we’ve had him, we don’t take him for granted.”\nJames’ teammate Chris Bosh also considered MVP of the season. From ESPN:\n“I don’t know who else you’d vote for \u0013 no offense to nobody else, with all due respect,” Bosh said in support of James. “But that’s just how good he’s played this year.”\nAt 28, James will be the youngest in league history to claim a fourth MVP. James joins Michael Jordan, Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabaar and Wilt Chamberlain as a player with at least four MVP awards. From ESPN’s report:\n“Anytime I’m mentioned with the greatest players to play the game it’s a wow factor,” James said of comparisons to other four-time MVPs. “I grew up and studied those guys, watched those guys. A few of them were my inspiration.”\nShare this:\n","source":"google_52778141777464"}
