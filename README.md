# NewsScraper

A project that, at its core, scrapes news data from the internet and extracts binary relations from the news using ReVerb. 

NewsScraper is split into two parts: news-scraper and news-converter. news-scraper does the actual scraping, what's described in the above paragraph; news-converter takes the data from news-scraper and converts it into a usable format.
